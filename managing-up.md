# Managing Up: Principles and Practices

A comprehensive guide for managing up effectively, understanding power dynamics, and building productive relationships with managers and senior leaders.

---

## Core Principle

**Managing up means being a competent operator who follows through, communicates appropriately, and drives toward business goals.** This elevates your actual and perceived value in an organization. You don't have to manage up, but your career will go further if you do.

---

## Part 1: The 15 Core Principles

### 1. Embrace Managing Up

Your manager is busy with their job, plus a bunch of worries you don't know about. They might feel awkward asking you to manage up more, so take the reins and manage up proactively.

**❌ Don't:**
> "It's my manager's job to manage me. I'll manage up when I'm promoted."

**✅ Do:**
> "I shouldn't have to manage up. But if I do, I'll take control and further my career."

### 2. Focus on the Punchline

Give enough context to avoid back-and-forth follow ups. Don't be coy when you can be direct. Assume your manager is task switching or checking your message between meetings—make it super easy for them to catch up.

**❌ Don't:**
> "This happened, then this other thing, this important thing that's completely buried, and then this other thing."

**✅ Do:**
> "Here's the minimum viable backstory, so we can spend time on the juicy stuff."

### 3. Show Your Thought Process

Showing your thought process helps others understand your rationale, logic, and assumptions. Even if they disagree, it gives something to push back on, which propels the process forward.

**❌ Don't:**
> "I recommend this."

**✅ Do:**
> "I recommend X. Here's the rationale, data, and examples of why this should work. The potential risks are Y, but we can address by doing Z. If you agree, I can start by doing [first step]."

### 4. Flag Potential Issues

When you wait to be told what to do, you put 100% of the responsibility on your manager. If you stay alert to help surface potential issues, you alleviate that burden.

**❌ Don't:**
> "This is a problem."

**✅ Do:**
> "This is a problem. Here's why it matters. I suggest doing X."

Or:
> "An important customer said X. I don't think it's a big deal, but I wanted to bring it up and run it by you."

### 5. Bring Solutions, Not Complaints

You don't need to know the exact solution to every problem. But complaining itself is rarely valuable.

**❌ Don't:**
> "This sucks."

**✅ Do:**
> "This sucks, so here's what I'm thinking we can do..."

**❌ Don't:**
> "This process is messy and time-consuming. It's so dumb. I hate doing this."

**✅ Do:**
> "This process isn't working because X. I'd like to update to Y process instead, which should be cheaper/faster/easier. Let me know what I might be missing or if you agree to proceed."

### 6. Use Information Hierarchy

Put your recommendation, action item, or question at the top, then context below. This allows folks to read as much or little of the context as they need.

**❌ Don't:**
> Action items, backstory, bottlenecks, and context all jumbled together

**✅ Do:**
> Action items or question at the top, context separately below

### 7. Keep Your Manager in the Loop

Trust isn't binary. One of the best ways to continually expand trust is to demonstrate consistent, reliable follow through and communication:

1. Say what you're going to do.
2. Do it.
3. Tell your manager you're doing it.
4. Tell your manager you did it.

Repeat. The problem is when you skip one of these steps.

**❌ Don't:**
> [Silence]

**✅ Do:**
> "We have 2 weeks until the deadline. We're at 33/50 students, and with X leads in the pipeline, it's not enough to hit our goal. So this week, I'll reach out to 100 new leads. I'd love to get your input on Y. Could we review tomorrow?"

### 8. Are You Being Micromanaged, or Do You Need to Communicate Better?

Poor communication skills and lack of managing up can lead to feeling micromanaged. At least some people who complain about being micromanaged are probably bad at communicating, and thus require more hands-on management.

**❌ Don't:**
> "Micromanagers are the worst. I wish they'd get off my back and just let me do my job."

**✅ Do:**
> "I wonder what's making them feel the need to micromanage. I'll review how I'm keeping them informed and align on what success looks like, so I can show I'm handling it. When we build up trust, the micromanaging should go down."

### 9. Over-Communication Might Be the Right Amount

Different folks have different thresholds of wanting to be kept in the loop. It's hard to tell a manager's preferences until you start working with them, but you can always ask upfront and iterate.

A more hands-on approach at first makes sense because both manager and direct report are establishing trust. Once trust is established, the manager usually eases off. The concept of **task-relevant maturity** is useful here: If you are skilled in an area, you likely need to give fewer updates about it. If you're new, your manager may want to stay closer until you show you've got it under control.

### 10. Proactively Assert What to Do

Suggest next steps—don't wait to be told what to do. Almost every leader instinctively asks, "Okay, so what? What should we do with this information?"

**❌ Don't:**
> "What should I do?"

**✅ Do:**
> "I recommend X. Here's rationale, data points, or examples of why this should work. The risk is Y but we can address by Z. If you agree, I'll start by doing [first step]."

### 11. Don't Only Ask Questions. Share Your Point of View Too

The problem with waiting to be told what to do is… you'll be told what to do. Don't wait to be told what to do.

**❌ Don't:**
> "Why? Why again? Why again? [Mic drop]"

**✅ Do:**
> "Why? My initial POV is [insight and rationale, patterns you're noticing]. I'm not 100% sure yet, so I'm curious how you're thinking about it, where you agree, where you see gaps."

Instead of asking what you should do, say:
- "I came up with 3 ideas to improve X. Can I get your feedback?"
- "I spent 15 minutes scenario planning and think X is best because Y."
- "My initial hunch is leaning toward X, but I don't have high conviction on this and would like to discuss with you."

### 12. Anticipate Questions

Anticipating questions is a skill that keeps on giving. If you can guess what your manager or colleagues will ask about, address it before they ask. This saves at least one cycle of back and forth.

**❌ Don't:**
> "My idea is X. So what do you think?"

**✅ Do:**
> "My idea is X. I thought you'd want to make sure the posts weren't just performing well on social, but actually drove customers down the funnel. So I pulled the top 20 posts that drove the most ideal customers this quarter and…"

### 13. Know When to Get Out

None of this works for managers who don't have your best interest in mind or are insecure about their own work. No amount of managing up can resolve deeply troublesome issues, so use your best judgment.

**❌ Don't:**
> "My manager undermines my work, throws me under the bus, and blames me for no reason. Managing up doesn't work."

**✅ Do:**
> "Managing up works, but not in a toxic environment. I'll find an organization that's a better fit and manage up to a manager who's eager to work with me."

### 14. Be Explicit About What You Need

Are you looking for a thought partner to help you shape a new, fuzzy idea? Are you looking for emotional support and someone to listen? What kind of feedback would be most helpful?

**❌ Don't:**
> "Hey, can you take a look?"

**✅ Do:**
> "Hey, can you take a look? I'm looking for directional feedback on whether it makes sense to go down this path, no need for line edits yet."

Or:
> "Can you approve this by 3pm today?"

Or:
> "I have updates on X. Let's discuss by tomorrow EOD because Y."

### 15. Expect to Manage Up Forever

At one point, I had been managing up for years, but in the back of my mind, I assumed I wouldn't have to do it anymore after I put in the years and hit an invisible threshold of seniority.

Until one day, I co-founded my own company. And.... I still had to manage up.

Every single leader has to manage up. Counterintuitively, senior leaders and executives are often best at it. They got to where they are because they know how to anticipate needs, communicate persuasively, and keep people in the loop.

## Part 2: Understanding Power Dynamics

### You Can't Change Your Manager

In a flat team structure, you and your manager might act like equals 99% of the time. But in the 1% of the time when there's a difference, you need to cater to them. You mold yourself around them. This is how the manager/direct report dynamic works.

**The structural dynamic of a manager/direct report relationship dictates that in the 1% of the time when one person's preferences outweigh the other's, your manager's preferences will take precedent.**

In productive environments, 99% of an issue is decided based on objective reasoning, logic, rationale, etc. I'm talking about the 1% where there's a standstill or deadlock, or where there's simply a philosophical or values-driven difference in how you and your manager see the world.

### Structural Dynamics and Incentives Win Over "Fairness"

If you expect "fairness" to win out, you will always feel slighted if it doesn't. So realizing that your manager's preferences will take precedence was freeing. If "fairness" were the dominating factor, perhaps they should change. But since the structural dynamic is the dominating factor, it explains why they don't have to change.

When you understand that, you can relax and stop blaming yourself.

### Ideally, You Should Be Simpatico from the Start

Most shoes that fit, actually fit from the beginning. You can't really "break in" shoes—you can change them by maybe 10% maximum. Otherwise, the shoe is the shoe. It is the way it is.

This means you really need to find managers that almost feel laughably comfortable when you start working with them, because when it interacts with reality, you will need that level of fit to make it work.

### Assess Your Level of Leverage More Accurately

We waste a lot of energy trying to change things we can't change. Once you stop subconsciously trying to change your manager, you can redirect that energy into areas where you can affect change.

This is not about "being more positive." It's about accurately assessing your leverage. If you misunderstand or miscalculate where you have leverage, you expend your energy accordingly.

### Try to Make the Most of Your Time Together

I've had the most productive relationships with my managers when I've accepted them as who they are, and tried to learn as much from them as I could.

Instead of trying to force them to embody the type of ideal manager I wanted, I saw them for who they are and tried to appreciate the worldviews they had.

To do this, try to adopt their worldviews as a "hat" or "lens" you could take on and off. What was it like to make decisions through their lens? If you prioritized the things they prioritized, how would that impact what you did and how you did it?

You won't report to your manager forever. You can take the best parts of what you learn from them and use it to inform how you want to lead yourself.
