# Investing and Wealth Generation

A practical guide for strategic investing and wealth generation, focusing on investment principles, evaluating opportunities, and building lasting wealth.

---

## Core Principle

**You never get rich investing—you get rich earning.** However, once you have earnings, strategic investing is essential for wealth generation. Money is a tool and a language. Your biggest ROI is on you and your time, but smart investments compound that ROI.

---

## Part 1: The Language of Money

### Understanding Money as a Tool

Money equals freedom. The more money you can make, the more decisions you can make by yourself. The rich understand that money is simply a tool and a toolkit—there's no emotional value to it.

**Key mindset shifts:**

- **From saving to earning:** You can only save your way to zero. There's limited downside but unlimited upside in earning.
- **From debt avoidance to intelligent debt:** The rich know how to use debt intelligently. They understand money as a tool, not something to fear.
- **From passive income myth to active leverage:** "Passive income" is often a misnomer. You've never earned a dollar passively—it's always been active. Once you have a decent chunk of change, you can put it into other people spending their active time to make more money for you.

### The Money Game

Every single way to make money is like a game. Some games are low-level games (like pickleball for athletes). If you want to become a top-paid athlete, you're probably not going to play pickleball—you'll play football or soccer internationally.

**The highest-paying game:** Finance. The number one category of people on the Forbes 100 list is some version of finance—whether that's buying and selling companies, being an active investor in equities, or being in hedge funds.

**The principle:** If you want to make more money, be in the industry where more people than anywhere else are on the Forbes 100 list.

## Part 2: Strategic Investing Principles

### Investment Fundamentals

Once you have earnings, invest strategically. But remember: **You never get rich investing. You get rich earning.**

**Investment principles:**
- When you're employed, you have less risk—this is the best time to invest in assets that can provide more income.
- Diversification matters for longevity over time.
- The best money managers in the world have diversification to some way, shape, or form.

**For W2 employees:**
- Buy series of hotels or Airbnbs and run those simultaneously
- Buy property management companies that run those Airbnbs
- Buy "people-light" businesses: laundromats, car washes (don't need a ton of employees)
- Buy vendors for people that you know and use inside of your W2
- Traditional investments: funds, stock market, REITs

### The Wealth Building Progression

Making money is a skill that you can get better at over time. There's a reliable progression that anyone can take to earn more and build wealth—think of it as a series of ladders side by side.

**The progression:**
1. **Time for money** - Trading time for money (hourly jobs, salaried positions)
2. **Your own service business** - Running your own services business
3. **Productized services** - Taking a set offering and bundling it with a fixed price
4. **Selling products** - Physical or digital products that scale

**Key principles for wealth building:**
- **Extra time and money need to be reinvested** - Increased earnings should go into new skills, investments, or businesses, not lifestyle inflation. All across society extra money—whether from a raise or working extra—disappears into lifestyle inflation or temporary purchases, when it could be put to work so much more effectively.
- **You can skip ahead, but you still have to learn the lessons from each step** - Jumping ahead means learning all lessons in one place, which takes longer and feels harder
- **Apply your existing skills in a new way** - Use skills you already have to build wealth (e.g., construction skills to renovate Airbnbs)
- **There's a difference between working for a better wage and truly building wealth** - Don't step backwards on the ladder
- **Use an earlier rung on the ladder to fund the next one** - Stay at your job longer to stockpile savings to fund the jump to the next ladder
- **Moving between ladders often means a decrease in income** - Plan for a valley to follow your current revenue peak. Sometimes that drop may be only for a few months, other times it could be a few years
- **Each step is easier with an audience** - Share your journey publicly to create supporters who root for your success
- **It takes longer than you think, but the results can be incredible** - Consistently reinvesting time and money into wealth creation rather than lifestyle inflation can have incredible results if allowed to play out for long enough

**When is it worth it to work for a wage?**
1. **When you are just getting started** - Early in your career, the important thing is to make enough to pay rent and buy groceries
2. **When you are learning a new skill** - If you can get paid to learn a new skill that will grow your earning potential, you absolutely should
3. **As a step in getting to a higher rung or on to the next ladder** - It always takes time, money, or both to move to a higher rung
4. **To build relationships and find mentors** - The right people will shape your mindset and opportunities
5. **When the work is rewarding and meaningful in its own right** - A lot of money is far from the only kind of wealth

**The principle:** The most important thing is that you aren't just treading water as you work for a wage. As much of that money as possible should be saved and invested to help you jump to the next ladder.

**Income growth shapes:**
- **Stair step:** Most people will experience a stair step approach to income—raises, promotions, additional projects
- **Linear:** Enough stair steps that are close together will simply look like a linear growth curve when you zoom out
- **Exponential:** Exponential growth comes from when each sale of a product truly makes the next sale come more easily—requires a product that you can sell repeatedly that can be created at a large scale

## Part 3: Good Business vs. Bad Business (Investment Evaluation)

### Defining a Good Investment

**Good business equals:**
- **Profitable and cash-flowing:** What's called a "cash flow" versus "cash suck" business
- **Sustainable:** It can exist for a long time
- **Historical:** It has existed for a long time
- **Understandable:** You can explain it to Grandma really easily
- **The Lindy effect:** The likelihood of the future continuing to cash flow just as it did in the past
- **Get paid upfront:** You get paid upfront for a service, not after you provide a service

**Bad business equals:**
- Unprofitable
- Hard to understand
- Hasn't been around for very long
- You have to provide the service before you get paid for the service
- Much harder game to win

**The trampoline vs. concrete floor:**
- **Cash flow businesses:** Have a trampoline that has a lot of give to it. You can make more mistakes as an investor because you have money coming in.
- **Cash suck businesses:** Have a concrete floor that has no give. You're going to jump out of the window sometimes and mess things up.

### Marketing Problem vs. Product Problem

**Three numbers you need to look at:**

1. **Referral rate:** How often do your customers tell somebody else that they need to buy something from you?
2. **Repurchase rate:** How often do your customers repurchase from you? They come, they buy one water bottle—not enough. You need to buy two or three.
3. **Churn:** How often do the customers, once they have you on a subscription plan or they're continuing to buy from you, bail out of that plan?

**These three numbers can tell you if you have:**
- A healthy product business, OR
- Just a great sales team

**The four R's of good business:**
1. **Reviews:** Ask your customers to say nice things about you continuously
2. **Referrals:** Get your customers to refer their friends to buy more things from you continuously
3. **Retention:** Keep them (find new customers, keep growing)
4. **Reduction of churn:** Keep them from bailing out

**The hierarchy:**
1. Always easier to sell your same customers more things continuously
2. Then you can sell your customers more expensive things continuously
3. Then you can get your customers to refer their friends to buy more things from you continuously
4. Then you can ask your customers to say nice things about you continuously (reviews)

## Part 4: Unlocking Optionality

### Building Multiple Income Streams

**The principle:** Once you've validated impact and demonstrated repeatable success, you can unlock optionality in your career. This means having multiple ways to generate income and not being dependent on a single source.

**Types of optionality:**

1. **Advising** - Cross between teaching, coaching, and organizational problem solving. Help CEOs, founders, and CxOs build practices that accelerate their growth. Engagements tend to last 6-12 months or longer. Provides high dollar value per person hour.

2. **Consulting** - More time intensive than advising, very project and deliverable focused with specific artifacts. Can do fractional consulting where you're working "part time" with a company and handling deliverables.

3. **Interim Work** - Full-time with an end date. Different from fractional work because you're spending the majority of your time in a given week with the company. Includes both cash and equity compensation.

4. **Coaching** - Focused on an individual, helping people transform their careers. Can border on therapy, requires significant emotional energy.

5. **Workshops** - "Advisor-in-a-box." Combines education with practical application. Can be highly lucrative but feel very transactional.

6. **Courses** - Creating educational content. Follows a power law distribution—most courses make a small amount of money, but successful ones can be very lucrative. Requires strong distribution.

7. **Paid Speaking Engagements** - Less lucrative on a per hour basis than other work, but helpful for testing out new frameworks and personal brand building.

8. **Membership / Subscription / Advertising** - Building an audience and monetizing through newsletter, podcast, or other content. Requires owning the relationship with your audience independent of platforms.

9. **Investing** - Early in lifecycle this is often a cost center rather than revenue generator, but can become significant over time.

**The principle:** Don't try to accelerate to the optionality phase too early. You need enough lived experience, frameworks, and repeatable success to share with people. When you're ready, try different options to see what fits your personality and skills.
