# Feedback: Giving and Receiving

A comprehensive guide for giving effective feedback in any direction, based on proven frameworks for upward and downward feedback.

---

## Core Principle

**Strategy, not self-expression.** Only say what will encourage behavior change. Strategy means only saying things that get you closer to changing the person's behavior. Self-expression is venting, having the last word, or trying to teach someone a lesson. Aim for behavior change, not proving you're right.

## Part 1: Giving Feedback Upward (To Senior Leaders)

### When to Apply
- When you need to give feedback to someone more powerful than you
- When you want to help a senior leader recognize patterns that are preventing results
- When you've exhausted other options (managing up, clarifying questions, acting like an owner)

### Key Principles

#### 1. The "Even More" Technique

Frame feedback as building on what they're already doing, not pointing out what they're missing.

**❌ Don't:**
> "We might need to give guidance to new hires."

**✅ Do:**
> "We may need to give even more guidance to new hires."

**Why this works:** The "before" is binary—they either did or didn't give guidance. The "after" assumes they did give guidance and suggests doing it more. This is much easier to accept.

#### 2. Use Yourself as an Example

Talk about yourself so it doesn't seem like you're pointing fingers.

**❌ Don't:**
> "You should try X."

**✅ Do:**
> "I used to struggle with this, and when I tried X, it really helped."

This works especially well when there's a power dynamic and/or the content might be sensitive.

#### 3. Adopt Diplomatic, Curiosity-Forward Language

Use phrases that ease into suggestions in a non-threatening way:

- "We might want to try…"
- "I wonder if..."
- "Perhaps we could..."
- "What are your thoughts on..."
- "One approach might be..."

You adopt the vibe of a helpful team member who has your leader's best interest in mind and wants to serve your organization. You're forward-looking, focused on what to potentially do going forward, not what went wrong.

#### 4. Bring Data and Examples to Support Your Point

Don't just make high-level, hand-waving statements. Share examples of what worked well in the past.

**Example: Guidance during projects**

**❌ Don't:**
> "We need to give more feedback during projects."

**✅ Do:**
> "I noticed when we reviewed the design mockups weekly with the client, they loved the final result. For this project, early check-ins could help us make sure we're aligned before going too far down a certain direction and could prevent rework."

**Why this works:**
- Ends with a clear, actionable suggestion
- Shows the upside of updating their approach
- Keeps it simple, logical, and positive
- Shares rationale in a collaborative way

## Part 2: Giving Feedback Downward (To Direct Reports)

### When to Apply
- During performance reviews
- When a direct report's self-assessment doesn't match your assessment
- When someone needs to improve but might react emotionally
- When you need to be honest without demotivating them

### Key Principles

#### 1. Strategy vs Self-Expression

Pare it back to the most critical feedback. What one thing can they work on that will make the biggest improvement? Focus on what to do differently moving forward, not past infractions.

**Strategy** = Only saying things that will incentivize the person to change in the right direction (probably 10% of what you initially want to say).

**Self-expression** = Venting, having the last word, or trying to teach someone a lesson. Anything that isn't 100% going to encourage improvement.

#### 2. If They Already Feel Remorseful, Don't Pour Salt in the Wound

If they messed up and already feel remorseful, there are diminishing returns to continuing to emphasize the damage. It makes them feel worse (less motivated) or defensive (less motivated).

Channel their emotions in a more productive direction instead.

#### 3. Take Responsibility for Your Role

When you take responsibility for your role in a situation, you engender massive amounts of goodwill. Most managers won't admit that anything is their fault.

Say things like:
- "It's on me that I didn't do X"
- "I should have set you up for success by doing Y"

This usually makes the other person more willing to acknowledge how they contributed.

#### 4. Acknowledge Strengths and Weaknesses as Two Sides of the Same Coin

Frame weaknesses as the shadow side of strengths.

**Example:**
> "Creativity, big picture thinking, and storytelling are your strengths, which makes you so great at X. The shadow side of this is I've noticed you're more likely to be very light on quantitative analysis and subconsciously avoid data. This totally makes sense, but the impact is [negative impact]. Going forward, I need to be on top of the weekly metrics so we can..."

**Why this works:** You're not triggering their ego. You're explaining that they're bad at X because they're good at Y, but we still need to address X.

#### 5. Cite Task-Relevant Maturity

You're NOT commenting on whether your team member is intelligent and capable. You're simply mentioning this person's experience, and therefore judgment, with a certain topic.

**Example:**
> "I thought you had more task-relevant maturity in this area than I realized. I was surprised by XYZ. That's on me. Going forward, it might make sense for us to be more closely aligned as you ramp up on this. What that looks like is... And when X happens, let's have you do..."

This removes shame around the conversation. You're both wanting to find out the best way to increase their impact.

#### 6. Replace "But" with "At the Same Time"

"But" negates all the nice things you said before. Your recipient will only hear what comes after "but."

**❌ Don't:**
> "I really like how you X. But when you Y, it has this negative impact."

**✅ Do:**
> "I really like how you X. At the same time, when you Y, it has this negative impact."

"At the same time" signals a difference like "but" does without the negativity. It's like "and" in that it shows a continuation, as opposed to a severe break or negation.

#### 7. Quote the Person Back to Themselves

Leverage cognitive dissonance and the principle of consistency. People want to be consistent with what they said and who they think they are.

**Example:**
> "You've mentioned you always want me to give you direct feedback and push you to be better. This is one of those times. I'm saying this to you because I know this wasn't your best work, and I know this doesn't reflect your abilities."

## Part 3: Universal Feedback Principles

### Apply These Regardless of Direction

#### 1. Consider Your Options First

Before giving feedback, especially upward:
- **First option:** "What can I do that's within my control to improve this situation?"
- **Second option:** "Can I live with this? How much does this bother me? Is it worth giving them feedback and what are my chances of success?"
- **Final option:** "I think I want to give this person some feedback."

Make sure YOU aren't the problem. Make sure you are managing up, asking clarifying questions, acting like an owner, etc. to get what you need.

#### 2. Adjust Based on Relationship and Context

Consider:
- Your relationship with the person
- Their idiosyncrasies and worldview
- The level of trust they have in you
- Your credibility with them

You might realize your relationship or credibility isn't strong enough for you to give them feedback—that's an equally appropriate conclusion.

#### 3. Timing and Setting Matter

- Always do it in a 1:1 setting
- NEVER lash out in a meeting
- Choose a time when both of you can focus
- For upward feedback, you might want to ask for time: "Hey, could I have 10 minutes of your time to share some thoughts I have?"

#### 4. Be Concrete and Concise

Avoid long diatribes and over-explaining. Use your judgment to share just enough context. Be concrete AND concise.

#### 5. Don't Have a "Well Actually..." Vibe

Share rationale in a collaborative way, not in a way that sounds obnoxious or like you're trying to prove you're smarter.
