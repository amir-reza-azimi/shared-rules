# Writing Guide: Concise and Clear Communication

A reference guide for writing documents, presentations, and stakeholder communications based on proven communication principles.

---

## Core Principle

**The goal of being concise is to create understanding as quickly and easily as possible.** Therefore, simply being succinct isn't enough. You must also be clear, compelling, and coherent.

---

## Part 1: Preparation and Structure

### 1. Figure Out Your Main Point First

Before writing or speaking, take a few seconds to prepare. This involves multiple cognitive steps:

1. Process the information
2. Make sense of it
3. Decide what's important
4. Organize it
5. Say it out loud

**Ask yourself:**
- What do you want to get out of this communication?
- What is the most important thing to share?
- What action do you need folks to take?

**Even a few seconds of preparation can make a positive difference.**

### 2. State Your Main Point in 2-3 Sentences

- **Aim for 2-3 sentences** — not one (analysis paralysis) or ten (monologue)
- This forces you to state your high-level thesis and what you need from the other person
- The point is not to capture everything — it's to frame the conversation upfront

**Benefits:**
- Your audience can relax knowing where you're taking them
- They can confirm if this is the right time/place to have this conversation
- They can easily focus on the context you share thereafter

### 3. Use "Main Point Above, Context Below" Structure

For written communication, separate the main point from your context:

**Structure:**
```
[Main point and action needed - 2-3 sentences]

[Context and supporting details below]
```

**Why this works:**
- Your reader immediately understands your point, then gets more details
- You give your reader agency — they can read as much or as little context as needed
- Prevents important information from being buried

**Example:**
> "FYI I met with a LinkedIn representative about their LinkedIn Recruiter tool. The next step is to discuss the ROI and whether we want to renew our subscription. Let's decide at the talent sync this Friday. For context, the below are meeting notes from the kick-off call."

### 4. Give the Right Amount of Context

Assess the situation to determine how much background information is necessary. The right amount of context depends on your audience's familiarity and what they need to know.

**Framework for assessing context needs:**

1. **Remind the reader of previous interactions** (if relevant)
   - Briefly reference prior communications to situate the current message
   - Example: "Following up on our conversation last week about the Q4 budget..."

2. **Be specific about what you need**
   - Clearly state what you require: feedback, approval, decision, or just information
   - Example: "Please review the attached proposal and provide feedback by Friday."
   - Example: "This is for your information; no action is required."

3. **Assess your audience's knowledge level**
   - Don't over-explain familiar concepts
   - Don't under-explain new or complex topics
   - Tailor the depth of context to what's needed for understanding

4. **Indicate if no action is needed**
   - If the message is purely informational, state that upfront
   - Prevents unnecessary back-and-forth

**Example of well-calibrated context:**
> "Please review the updated pitch for the X customer. I've incorporated your feedback and included a change summary below. Let me know if you have any questions. I'll plan on shipping tomorrow morning."

## Part 2: Rigorous Thinking

### 5. Question Your Assumptions

Before presenting an idea or recommendation, critically evaluate your assumptions:

**Questions to ask yourself:**
- What assumptions am I making?
- What evidence supports these assumptions?
- What could go wrong?
- How can I mitigate potential issues?
- What alternative perspectives should I consider?

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents lazy thinking and weak arguments
- Strengthens your communication by addressing potential objections upfront
- Demonstrates thoroughness and strategic thinking

### 6. Anticipate Questions and Objections

Think through what your audience might ask or push back on:

**Proactive approach:**
- Address potential questions within your communication
- Explain how your proposal differs from alternatives
- Clarify the benefits and trade-offs
- State your assumptions explicitly so others can challenge them constructively

**Example:**
> "I'm recommending we extend the enrollment period to six weeks. I'm assuming this won't impact our staffing capacity, but we should verify with operations. The main risk is delayed revenue recognition, which I've accounted for in the financial model below."

## Part 3: What to Avoid

### 7. Avoid Explaining Events Chronologically

We experience events in chronological order, but explaining what happened this way can be confusing.

**❌ Don't:**
> "Well this happened, then this other thing, and here's the process of what I did for that. Oh yeah, then this thing but that's not important, this important thing that's completely buried, and then this other thing, and…"

**✅ Do:**
> "Here's the important thing I want to discuss. Here's what I need from you. Here are a few sentences about the situation, with the option to elaborate if needed."

**When you say your punchline upfront, you will instantly seem more competent, strategic, and organized.** Keep the backstory short, and skip the play-by-play of what you did at each step (you can always share this if asked).

### 8. Avoid Too Much Technical Detail Without Context

Don't share technical information without explaining what it means or why it matters.

**Common mistakes:**
- Mentioning technical tools/processes without business impact
- Failing to explain why things matter in simple terms
- Not connecting technical details to outcomes or risks

**Instead:**
- Translate technical details into business impact
- Explain risks and learnings
- Make it clear how the project is going (good/bad/at risk)

### 9. Avoid Being Too Concise (Missing Critical Information)

There is such a thing as being too concise. Don't leave out crucial information because you were trying to be concise.

**What to include proactively:**
- Information needed to make a decision (don't make people ask for it)
- Basic context that sets up better questions
- Assumptions and rationale behind recommendations

**Remember:** Do not force other people to do the heavy lifting to draw basic information out of you piece by piece. This is lazy and irresponsible.

---

## Part 4: Techniques for Clarity

### 10. Constantly Remind Yourself to Shorten Your Delivery

Develop an always-on filter as a meta voice that's hearing yourself talk. Ask:

- Is this the shortest way you can explain this?
- Is this backstory REALLY necessary?
- What are you really trying to say? Can you just say that?
- Should I get back to my main point?

**Practice:** Say different versions of the same thing in increasingly more concise ways. See how far you can push yourself.

### 11. Use Signposting for Longer Communications

In verbal communication, your audience is limited by your pacing and what you reveal line by line. Frame the conversation upfront — tell them where you're taking them.

**Examples of signposting:**
> "For context, we left off last week with [the problem the team was facing]. So I took a stab at solving these issues, and today I will review the changes I made."

> "The part that's most important to point out is…"

> "First, I'll give a quick high-level view of the three major changes, then I'll highlight specific in-product copy changes that I believe make the experience more intuitive."

### 12. Offer to Elaborate (But Be Specific)

Don't just say, "I can elaborate on anything." That puts the mental load on the other person.

**❌ Don't:**
> "Let me know what you want to know."

**✅ Do:**
> "I can elaborate more on a few areas: For example, the other options I looked at, including (a) if we optimized for speed and could get this done in a week, (b) cheaper/more expensive options that I thought weren't worth it, and (c) looking ahead a few steps, the risks I foresee and how I'm planning to derisk."

### 13. Exercise Situational Awareness

**When speaking:**
- Notice if people are starting to lose interest
- Pause sooner than you think and give the other person a chance to respond
- Look for a natural stopping point to wrap up
- Think about how to end gracefully while you're still talking

**People who speak in giant run-on sentences seem more junior.** Leaders breathe in between talking and give people opportunities to jump in.

## Part 5: Fixing Limbo Writing (When Ideas Are Unclear)

### 14. Clarify What You Want to Say in the First Place

Writing is the vessel to express your idea. If you don't know what you want to say, no amount of good writing can compensate for the lack of an idea.

### 15. Finish the Knock-Knock Joke

Does the idea feel incomplete? Sometimes, we write the first half of a knock-knock joke, but we forget the payoff. Add the "Who's there?" to complete your thought.

**Even a tweet has a narrative arc.** Even in 280 characters, there's a beginning, middle, and end. Make sure whatever you're writing is a standalone unit.

### 16. Explicitly State Your Assumptions and Rationale

Share the thought process behind your recommendation. This helps your manager give feedback on specific logical gaps instead of tossing out your whole idea. It creates the basis for a productive conversation.

### 17. Make Your Contribution Additive

**Scarce + relevant = valuable.** Teach something people don't already know. What's both surprising and true? Instead of summarizing and recapping, how can you make your contribution additive?

### 18. Clarify Your Stance

Have a spiky point of view rooted in evidence that others can disagree with.

### 19. Articulate the Action You Want Your Reader to Take

Once you have your call-to-action, give them reasons to give you an enthusiastic yes.

**Remember:** Messaging is one of the few levers available for getting your customers to take action. Don't waste this lever.

### 20. Avoid Planting Negative Ideas

"I am not a crook" makes people think you are a crook. Plant ideas you want people to think of. Avoid incepting negative ideas.

---

## Part 6: Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 21. Failing to Include Details Necessary for the Decision

Proactively give people what they need to make a decision. If they need to see comparisons, plans, or data to decide, include it upfront. This saves follow-up cycles and allows faster movement.

### 22. Misreading the Task at Hand

Make sure your response is specific to what was asked. Don't provide generic advice when specific, targeted input is needed.

### 23. Sharing Only Notes Without Analysis

With AI tools that can summarize notes, sharing only notes is not that helpful. It's more valuable to share notes AND your takeaways, analysis, and insights.
