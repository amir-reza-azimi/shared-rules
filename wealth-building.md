# Wealth Building: Principles and Practices

A comprehensive guide for building wealth through earning, learning, and strategic investing, based on proven frameworks from finance and business acquisition.

---

## Core Principle

**You never get rich investing—you get rich earning.** Money is a tool and a language. The most important language you'll ever learn is the language of money. If you understand what attracts money, you probably will never have to work again in your life. Your biggest ROI is on you and your time.

---

## Part 1: The Language of Money

### Understanding Money as a Tool

Money equals freedom. The more money you can make, the more decisions you can make by yourself. The rich understand that money is simply a tool and a toolkit—there's no emotional value to it.

**Key mindset shifts:**

- **From saving to earning:** You can only save your way to zero. There's limited downside but unlimited upside in earning.
- **From debt avoidance to intelligent debt:** The rich know how to use debt intelligently. They understand money as a tool, not something to fear.
- **From passive income myth to active leverage:** "Passive income" is often a misnomer. You've never earned a dollar passively—it's always been active. Once you have a decent chunk of change, you can put it into other people spending their active time to make more money for you.

### The Money Game

Every single way to make money is like a game. Some games are low-level games (like pickleball for athletes). If you want to become a top-paid athlete, you're probably not going to play pickleball—you'll play football or soccer internationally.

**The highest-paying game:** Finance. The number one category of people on the Forbes 100 list is some version of finance—whether that's buying and selling companies, being an active investor in equities, or being in hedge funds.

**The principle:** If you want to make more money, don't be a teacher (not a highly paid job). Be in the industry where more people than anywhere else are on the Forbes 100 list.

## Part 2: Learn, Earn, Invest, Repeat

### The Career Progression Framework

**Learn → Earn → Invest → Repeat**

#### Phase 1: Learning (20s)

When you're in your 20s, you're in your learning phase. You still want to try to increase your earnings, but if you had to choose between earning more or learning, optimize for learning.

**Why learning has unlimited upside potential:**
- You're never going to go in your 20s from making $30k a year to $300k a year because you negotiated a better salary (very unlikely).
- What you very well could do: Learn something additional, and that one skill can compound over 30 years to multiple millions or more.

**Where to learn:**
- Go to big corporations where you get well-paid, they train you a lot, and then you put an exit clock on: "Two years from now I'm going to leave at the moment in which they won't pay me more or I'm not learning."
- Example: Vanguard invested $100,000 a year into new hires through training programs, licenses, and education.

#### Phase 2: Earning (Late 20s to Early 30s)

Start thinking more about earning. How can you make more money?

**The key insight:** Your biggest ROI is on you and your time. Once you understand that, it's: How can you make your time your best investment possible?

**How to increase earnings:**

1. **Understand how a business makes money:** Understand how you make money for a business and how every action you make makes a business more or less money.

2. **Negotiate a percentage of the money you make the business:**
   > "Hey, I want to make more money at this company, but I would never want to take more money just because I want it—of course I understand how business works. Instead, I was thinking: If I hit this goal which is 25% above the goal that you set for me, I'd love to make 5% of that additional 25% I brought in. You get to keep the extra 20%, you beat your goals, I look good compared to all the rest of everybody else, and I make money if you make money. Would you be open to something like that?"

3. **Determine if you're a cost center or profit center:** 
   - Are you directly contributing to revenue?
   - Are you helping somebody contribute to revenue?
   - Or are you a cost?
   - If you're a cost, what are you doing there?

4. **Get on the profit center side:** Sales jobs, leadership roles, recruiting jobs—jobs where if you work more and hit your goals, you can make more money.

#### Phase 3: Investing (Ongoing)

Once you have earnings, invest strategically. But remember: **You never get rich investing. You get rich earning.**

**Investment principles:**
- When you're employed, you have less risk—this is the best time to invest in assets that can provide more income.
- Diversification matters for longevity over time.
- The best money managers in the world have diversification to some way, shape, or form.

**For W2 employees:**
- Buy series of hotels or Airbnbs and run those simultaneously
- Buy property management companies that run those Airbnbs
- Buy "people-light" businesses: laundromats, car washes (don't need a ton of employees)
- Buy vendors for people that you know and use inside of your W2
- Traditional investments: funds, stock market, REITs

## Part 3: The 9-to-5 Strategy

### Why Start with a 9-to-5

Starting with a 9-to-5 is super underrated today. You can learn so much—somebody else is paying you to learn if you have the right mindset and approach.

**The approach:**
1. Go work at a 9-to-5 in the industry that pays you more than anywhere else (finance).
2. When you're young, you have an incredible ability to withstand pain. It's much easier to do it when you're in your 20s than in your 40s or 50s.
3. Work 10-11 hour days. Be voracious in knowledge accumulation.
4. Once you have some skill set that is valuable enough, then you can assert your will on your hours, etc.

**The exit strategy:** Put an exit clock on. "Two years from now I'm going to leave at the moment in which they won't pay me more or I'm not learning."

**The result:** You accumulate millions before you ever run your own business. You learn to invest the entire time you're doing it, you're making a lot of money while you're doing it, and you're putting the money back into the stock market and into deals.

---

## Part 4: Economic Interconnectedness

### The Power of Proximity

**The study:** Economic interconnectedness shows that if there are two neighborhoods with the same average salary ($50k), but one neighborhood has a few people who make a million dollars a year (they just have a few rich people that interact with some of the poorer people), this group of people has a 30% higher earnings over the course of their life through the same skill set and experience.

**The principle:** You want two things:
1. Somewhere you can learn as much as humanly possible
2. Somewhere where you're around people who have more money than you do by orders of magnitude (if at all possible)

**Why this works:**
- You realize that other things are possible—you don't have this ceiling of false rules that we learn
- You have conversations with these individuals and get networking opportunities
- You get advice from people who have already done a thing that you want to do
- Maybe they hire you

**The proximity effect:** If you sit next to a high performer, 15% increase in productivity. If you sit next to a low performer, 30% decrease in productivity.

**Example:** If you make $100k a year and sit next to a high performer, you make $115k (gross generalization). If you sit next to a low performer, you might only make $70k.

---

## Part 5: Getting in Front of High Performers

### How to Access Mentors and High Performers

**The best way to get mentors today:** Go work for them. Don't ask to do stuff one-off. Go to the highest-performing companies you think you can get into. If they're not that, switch to another one. **You get paid to get mentored.**

**Strategies:**

1. **Apply like a sniper rifle, not a shotgun:**
   - Every single company that is growing has a careers page
   - You will be shocked how often those are not applied to across multiple companies
   - How seldom they are chased

2. **Go above and beyond in applications:**
   - Don't just fill out the resume
   - Write an entire newsletter in their voice and send it to them
   - Pull some profiles for other candidates you thought might be interesting
   - Read books on the topic and share what you learned
   - Give them a compliment (ego stroke) and show you understand what they need

3. **Be obstinate in getting it:**
   - Travel to interview in multiple places on your own dime
   - Heckle with ideas for the business
   - Give contacts and leads
   - Send custom gifts
   - Do eight interviews if needed

4. **The filter test:** If someone says "let's grab lunch" and you're not in their city, hop on a plane. Most people won't do this. This is an excellent filter.

**The principle:** A little bit of effort shows such a decrease of risk as a new hire. Most of the reasons that people don't work out when you hire them is not capability—it's effort.

---

## Part 6: Grit and Relentlessness

### The Most Learnable Skill

**Winning is probably one of the most learnable skill sets out there when it comes to business** because the only thing that really differentiates most businesses from winning and losing is giving up.

**The research:** By and large, the reason why Silicon Valley wants two founders is because the number one risk for investing in a company is that a founder gives up. Number one.

**The principle:** You don't have to be smarter than anybody else. You don't have to be richer than anybody else. You don't have to be better connected. You just have to be a little bit aggressively relentless.

**How to screen for grit:**

1. **History of winning:** I want to see a history of winning in some way, shape, or form. Hard to beat a losing streak.
   - Good: "I came to this startup, the startup was growing really fast, I outgrew the position, and I was ready for my next adventure."
   - Bad: "I came to this position, the company kind of failed, I was bored, it didn't work out."

2. **The exit interview technique:** Take them through every single company they've ever been at. Ask them:
   - Why did you go to that company?
   - Why did you leave?
   
   These two questions tell you a lot about: Do they give up? Do they chase things? Do they allow things to come to them?

**Red flags:**
- "I didn't like my boss"
- "The hours were too long"
- "They wanted me to work on..."

**The principle:** The more pain you can tolerate in business, the higher likelihood you'll succeed over time. It's just shots on goal.

---

## Part 7: Rich Mindset vs. Broke Mindset

### The Armor of No vs. The Coat of No

**Rich people:** They really don't believe in that word "impossible." They have what you might call an **armor of NOs**. Rich people have gotten told no so many times, they've been rejected so many times, that it almost just bounces off of them. They kind of go: "Yeah, I'm going to do it anyway. Thanks for the feedback. I'm going to try it."

**Broke people:** They have **confirmation bias of no**. When stuff has happened to them that's bad or when stuff hasn't worked out, instead of an armor of no, they're wearing a coat of no. They're like: "Yep, just let it in. Let's just build some more on this coat. Let's make this cape longer."

**Visualize it:** A deflection (armor) versus an accumulation (coat) of no's.

**The difference:**
- **Allies:** People who want you to win. They often tell you: "Do more. Go harder. Keep going."
- **Friends:** People who want you to stay with them whatever level they're at. They say: "That's not possible. It worked for you but it wouldn't work for me."

**The monk's perspective:** As you get rich, you sort of rise up. Your friends, family, colleagues are sort of these corners. As you start rising in wealth or success, they're like: "Wait a second, you're leaving me behind. I love you, I don't want you to leave me." But as you get higher, you pull the rest of them along with you. With most friends, all they see is this bottom part of your journey. They don't actually realize forward-looking you're going to take them with you.

**The mirror effect:** When you become really successful, you are a mirror on the things somebody else could have been. You are a reflection of every decision that they made that was short-term as opposed to long-term. You've lost many a friend by the mirror.

**The research on "worthless friends":** Arthur Brooks' research shows that having "worthless friends" (friends you have no transactional want from—they don't want anything from you, you don't want anything from them) materially increases our happiness. These transactional friendships actually end up in many ways decreasing our happiness.

**The principle:** You won't succeed very far if you stay around the same people that you started with.

---

## Part 8: Buying Businesses vs. Starting from Scratch

### Why Buy Instead of Build

**The principle:** It's very hard these days to make a profitable business. There's never been a harder time to make a profitable business. There's never been an easier time to start a business.

**Why buying is better:**
- You know it's already making money
- It has a history of past performance
- Best predictor of future behavior is past behavior (it's not a guarantee, but it is a higher indicator)
- You can operationalize them
- You can increase the growth

**The undercover billionaire approach:** If you were dropped off in a random town with $100, a phone, and no contacts:

1. **Find the most expensive thing to sell that you could sell:** The fastest way to make money when you have no money is find other people who already have something valuable and sell it to other people.

2. **Negotiate a portion of the business:** Go to businesses, broker deals, close deals, then say: "Can I get a percentage of your company for all the deals that I brought in?"

3. **Use seller financing:** Go door-to-door saying: "Have you ever thought about selling your business?" Using seller financing to basically acquire the business with very little risk.

**The principle:** Business owners have that all the time. People underestimate it. If somebody came to you with the right price and the right terms to sell, you'd be like: "Yeah, take this thing. Take it."

---

## Part 9: Good Business vs. Bad Business

### Defining a Good Business

**Good business equals:**
- **Profitable and cash-flowing:** What's called a "cash flow" versus "cash suck" business
- **Sustainable:** It can exist for a long time
- **Historical:** It has existed for a long time
- **Understandable:** You can explain it to Grandma really easily
- **The Lindy effect:** The likelihood of the future continuing to cash flow just as it did in the past
- **Get paid upfront:** You get paid upfront for a service, not after you provide a service

**Bad business equals:**
- Unprofitable
- Hard to understand
- Hasn't been around for very long
- You have to provide the service before you get paid for the service
- Much harder game to win

**The trampoline vs. concrete floor:**
- **Cash flow businesses:** Have a trampoline that has a lot of give to it. You can make more mistakes as an entrepreneur because you have money coming in.
- **Cash suck businesses:** Have a concrete floor that has no give. You're going to jump out of the window sometimes and mess things up.

### Marketing Problem vs. Product Problem

**Three numbers you need to look at:**

1. **Referral rate:** How often do your customers tell somebody else that they need to buy something from you?
2. **Repurchase rate:** How often do your customers repurchase from you? They come, they buy one water bottle—not enough. You need to buy two or three.
3. **Churn:** How often do the customers, once they have you on a subscription plan or they're continuing to buy from you, bail out of that plan?

**These three numbers can tell you if you have:**
- A healthy product business, OR
- Just a great sales team

**The four R's of good business:**
1. **Reviews:** Ask your customers to say nice things about you continuously
2. **Referrals:** Get your customers to refer their friends to buy more things from you continuously
3. **Retention:** Keep them (find new customers, keep growing)
4. **Reduction of churn:** Keep them from bailing out

**The hierarchy:**
1. Always easier to sell your same customers more things continuously
2. Then you can sell your customers more expensive things continuously
3. Then you can get your customers to refer their friends to buy more things from you continuously
4. Then you can ask your customers to say nice things about you continuously (reviews)

---

## Part 10: Hiring and Building Teams

### The Two Critical Questions

**Question 1: Who are you and what are your strengths and weaknesses?**

Often times your first hire in a business needs to be somebody who can do the opposite of what you can do. So it's actually not about them—it's about: Can you define the problem first?

**Most of the reasons why good hires do not work out:** The person and the problem set has not been clearly defined. We tend to like people that are like us. We shouldn't always hire people that are like us. In fact, we often should not.

**The Kolbe test:** Figure out what type of personality they have:
- **Fast action:** We do things right away
- **Implementer:** I like to do things consistently over time

If you're high fast action and low implementation, you need an implementation person. You don't need a bunch of ideas people. You're kind of an idea person. You need the opposite of that.

**Question 2: How can you figure out are they that type of person and can they handle that type of problem?**

**For implementers:**
- "I'd love to see how you organize your calendar. Can you show it to me?" (Real-time, pop up on Zoom)
- If they're an implementer, it's probably highly detailed, it's color-coded, it's assigned specific timelines
- If it's kind of all over the place or there's mismatched things on top of it—not an implementer

**For fast action:**
- "Well, hey, we're in the business right now. This is our problem. What would you do about it right now today?"
- "How long would that take you to do something like that?"
- "I'd love to pay you a thousand bucks to do a project scope for me. How fast could you turn around a project scope for me?"
- If they're like "oh, a week"—that's not your person. It needs to be a 24-hour window.

**The principle:** If you want to make a lot of money, you got to figure out that every problem is a people problem. Every additional profit is determined by people.

---

## Part 11: High Performers

### Traits of High Performers

**1. Be around other high performers:**
- Try to find a group of people that look like the life that you want in one shape or another

**2. Always do the things that you say you're going to do:**
- Simply say you're going to do a thing and follow through on doing the thing. That is very rare.
- Keep a project management system (Notion task list with databases and priorities)
- Every single day, look at that task list and say: "Did I promise something to somebody?"
- Over-communicate almost. Let the person know: "I'm taking this really seriously."

**3. Helpers, not yelpers:**
- High performers are the helpers. They're never the yelpers.
- When you're a high performer, you realize things like: The average small business needs 20 positive reviews to overshadow one negative review.
- Every time you do that to a small business, you could be crippling it with the one thing that happened in that small business.

**4. Usually quite giving:**
- They sit from such a place of abundance and mutual winning
- They do not think that if Shane wins, I can't win
- If he gets this, that means that I'm less than

**5. Kind, not nice:**
- **Being nice:** Pretending to listen to somebody's story about their kids and thinking that they'll like you more because you pretend to be interesting
- **Being kind:** When you see somebody struggling on the side of the road with a flat tire, you get out and you help them with it
- Being kind might be: "I'm so excited for that for you. Hey, you know I got to do this other thing and work right now, but when you need help on that thing so that you can actually leave to go hang out with your kid this weekend, I will help you with it so you can get out faster."

---

## Part 12: Managing Underperformance

### Recognizing and Dealing with Underperformance

**The principle:** You need to be faster. The good thing for anybody listening is: You don't have to be perfect.

**The approach:**

1. **Start with the end in mind:** When people come on to your company, start with a 30-60-90 day plan with every single person that you bring on board—even a new assistant.

2. **30-60-90 day plans have very specific outcomes:**
   - If those outcomes don't happen at 30 days for your first check-in—first red flag
   - They don't have it in 60 days—second red flag
   - Third red flag—gone from the company

3. **Quarterly KPIs:**
   - If you're hitting those, then we're good to go, you keep motoring
   - If you have a quarter where you're not hitting those—okay, we've got first red flag
   - Depending on the position, if you have another month or sometimes another quarter of it—that means that you let go

4. **The golden bridge:** Give them a golden bridge on which to retreat. Sun Tzu talks about his enemies in this way. Giving your employees a golden bridge on which to retreat is lovely too.

5. **Never talk badly about former employees:** If you've ever worked at a company and somebody gets fired at that company and then the boss talks badly about that person, it doesn't actually make the boss look better. It makes you think: "Oh, so when I eventually leave, they're going to talk about me like that."

**The principle:** Most often people self-select. They kind of know when they're just not a culture fit. When maybe they don't want to run so hard anymore. When the thing you do is no longer your obsession. When you're no longer learning.

**The graceful exit:** "Listen, you've taught me so much. Thank you for letting me work here for this period of time. I hope I've been high value to you. I'm ready for my next evolution, and I want to make sure you have a smooth transition. How can we do that?"

---

## Part 13: Money and Attention

### Money Likes Attention

**The principle:** Money likes attention just like a mistress does. If you don't pay attention to her, somebody else will.

**What to do:**

1. **Obsess on race to your first $500k:**
   - Shows that happiness increases post $500k in income (or up to $500k in income)
   - After $500k, they're sort of these plateaus and it's not really materially different
   - Feel no shame about that

2. **Obsess on money on a daily basis:**
   - Are you looking at your bank account?
   - Are you looking at the bank account of your business?
   - Are you looking at how much you make or sell in products?
   - Are you taking one action every single day to make more money—a money-related action?

**The principle:** If you do those things, you'll kind of be surprised at how you can compound over time.

### Earning vs. Saving

**The principle:** It's always easier in the beginning to save, but easier in the long term to earn.

**Why we've been told to save more:**
- If we save consistently, we're putting money into third-party investment products
- We have money sitting at banks
- If we save, we are helping a lot of other individuals make money
- If we earn and invest money in our individual businesses, we are actually giving money back to employees, we are giving money back to local economies
- Saving benefits a few really big guys. Earning benefits a lot of little guys

**The principle:** Money equals freedom. The more money you can make, the more decisions that you can make by yourself. Most people don't want free people. The people on high really want us to follow rules and to think in terms of safety, not opportunity.

**The goal:** Obsess on making money because then you get to push back when people tell you things that you don't want to do. Then you have freedom.

---

## Part 14: Negotiation and the First No

### The First No Is Not the Final No

**The principle:** The first no is really the final no—if you stop at the first no, that's a great line. You're done. But most people are not going to go past the first no, so you've already differentiated yourself.

**Learning from other cultures:**
- Americans in particular are brought up not to negotiate. It's like: "The price is the price."
- A lot of other cultures: The price is the starting point.
- Learning from other cultures on negotiation is such a life hack because they do it like a second language.

**The approach:**
- Every time you ask for something, there's a big smile
- Very diminutive, kind of shrugged shoulders: "Well, we could do this, but like we could do that. What do you think about that?"
- The whole time you're negotiating with them, you like the guy

**Examples:**
- Go into coffee shops (even Starbucks) and order a coffee, then go: "I'd love a discount." Then shut up.
- "Well, I'd just love one, like if that was at all possible. Is there any way for me to get a discount?"
- Often you are rejected, but sometimes you are not.

**Door knocking example:**
- Every time they paint a house, they ask their employees to door knock for an hour
- After about six or eight doors, one of the people that we knocked on was like: "Oh, actually I've been needing this and this and this and that." That's a $5,000 purchase.
- In the span of 20 minutes, the company made $5,000 from six or seven door knocks.

**The principle:** How often is money sitting right in front of you, but you're just not doing what it takes to grab it? Asking and rejection is one of the biggest reasons why we don't.

---

## Part 15: Reputation and Brand

### Reputation Is Your Most Valuable Asset

**Buffett's principle:** If an employee makes a mistake and loses us money, I will allow that. But if an employee makes a mistake and hurts our reputation, they will immediately be fired.

**Why:** It's very hard to get back your reputation, especially if it's your fault—you did something that is out of sync with who you say you are publicly.

### Building and Protecting Reputation

**1. Be as transparent as humanly possible:**
- On all the things good, bad, and otherwise that are true with you
- Say the quiet part out loud as often as humanly possible

**2. Inoculations against reputation:**
- Can you say things a few times that you think are very very true, but you know will be very very unpopular?
- If you do that so often, then people don't get that surprised by what you say
- Example: Joe Rogan often says the quiet part out loud. He says things he knows will be quite unpopular. Because he does that, people think he's telling the truth more often, and his audience is inoculated.

**3. Your reputation is cultivated:**
- It is this series of small decisions you make every single day that becomes the person that people think you are
- Try to really have congruence between that

**4. If you're going to try to be an influencer or celebrity:**
- It comes with the territory
- That's a decision you have to make one way or the other
- People who are very famous and well-known on the internet are obsessed with their reputation and brand. It is never by accident. This is cultivated. It is created. It is mocked up. It is PowerPoint.

**Example:** The Rock's Instagram—count how many of those pieces of content are an ad. Almost every post is. But he has such a strong brand, and every single thing that he promotes is so tied into his brand that it feels effortless. But it is absolutely not effortless.

**The principle:** Nobody gets famous by accident, for the most part. They all cultivated it.

---

## Part 16: Focus and Business Strategy

### When to Focus vs. When to Layer

**First rodeo rule:** If it's the first rodeo and the first time you've ever run a business, do one thing really well until that thing is profitable, self-sustainable, and you don't have to focus on it 100% of the time.

**Multi-time founder:** If it's not your first rodeo and you've already had a successful exit or two, then you can get better at layering.

**The creative test:** Are they a creative or not? Does 1 plus 1 equal 3?

**Example:** Kim Kardashian has her big media empire. She's looking for better ways to monetize that audience, so she has Skims, plus she has Sky (her private equity portfolio), plus she has her cosmetics company. But they're all sort of a creative because they use her media platform, and she gets to sell similar things to her audience and increase her overall basket size.

**The principle:** It has to really ladder into the same portfolio. Otherwise, you're distracting yourself.

**Red flag:** Anytime you see a startup founder who takes capital from third parties and they start doing Twitter threads and writing blog posts—it's like a red flag (unless they're a media company). No, no, no. Stay focused.

## Key Takeaways

1. **You never get rich investing—you get rich earning.** Your biggest ROI is on you and your time.

2. **Learn, earn, invest, repeat.** Optimize for learning in your 20s, earning in your late 20s/early 30s, then invest strategically.

3. **The 9-to-5 strategy works.** Start in high-paying industries (finance), get trained, accumulate capital, then exit when you're not learning or earning more.

4. **Economic interconnectedness matters.** Be around people who have more money than you by orders of magnitude. Proximity to high performers increases productivity by 15%.

5. **Get mentors by working for them.** Don't ask for one-off help. Apply to work at high-performing companies. You get paid to get mentored.

6. **Grit is the most learnable skill.** The number one risk in business is giving up. Be aggressively relentless.

7. **Rich mindset = armor of no's (deflection). Broke mindset = coat of no's (accumulation).** Surround yourself with allies who want you to win.

8. **Buy businesses, don't always build.** Past performance predicts future behavior. It's easier to buy a profitable business than start one.

9. **Good business = profitable, sustainable, historical, understandable, Lindy effect, get paid upfront.** Bad business = unprofitable, cash suck, provide service before payment.

10. **Every problem is a people problem.** Every additional profit is determined by people. Hire complementary skills, not people like you.

11. **High performers: be around them, do what you say, be helpers not yelpers, be giving, be kind not nice.**

12. **Money likes attention.** Obsess on race to $500k. Take one money-related action every single day. Look at your accounts daily.

13. **The first no is not the final no.** Learn negotiation from other cultures. Most people stop at the first no—differentiate yourself.

14. **Reputation is your most valuable asset.** Be transparent, do inoculations against reputation, cultivate it daily. It's a series of small decisions.

15. **Focus vs. layer:** First rodeo = do one thing really well. Multi-time founder = can layer. Must be a creative (1+1=3) that ladders into portfolio.
