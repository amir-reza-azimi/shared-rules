# Entrepreneurship: Starting, Buying, and Building

A practical guide for entrepreneurship, covering buying vs. starting businesses, evaluating business opportunities, building a personal brand, and strategic focus.

---

## Core Principle

**It's very hard these days to make a profitable business. There's never been a harder time to make a profitable business. There's never been an easier time to start a business.** Focus on what works: buying proven businesses, evaluating opportunities rigorously, building your personal brand, and maintaining strategic focus.

---

## Part 1: Buying Businesses vs. Starting from Scratch

### Why Buy Instead of Build

**The principle:** It's very hard these days to make a profitable business. There's never been a harder time to make a profitable business. There's never been an easier time to start a business.

**Why buying is better:**
- You know it's already making money
- It has a history of past performance
- Best predictor of future behavior is past behavior (it's not a guarantee, but it is a higher indicator)
- You can operationalize them
- You can increase the growth

**The undercover billionaire approach:** If you were dropped off in a random town with $100, a phone, and no contacts:

1. **Find the most expensive thing to sell that you could sell:** The fastest way to make money when you have no money is find other people who already have something valuable and sell it to other people.

2. **Negotiate a portion of the business:** Go to businesses, broker deals, close deals, then say: "Can I get a percentage of your company for all the deals that I brought in?"

3. **Use seller financing:** Go door-to-door saying: "Have you ever thought about selling your business?" Using seller financing to basically acquire the business with very little risk.

**The principle:** Business owners have that all the time. People underestimate it. If somebody came to you with the right price and the right terms to sell, you'd be like: "Yeah, take this thing. Take it."

## Part 2: Good Business vs. Bad Business

### Defining a Good Business

**Good business equals:**
- **Profitable and cash-flowing:** What's called a "cash flow" versus "cash suck" business
- **Sustainable:** It can exist for a long time
- **Historical:** It has existed for a long time
- **Understandable:** You can explain it to Grandma really easily
- **The Lindy effect:** The likelihood of the future continuing to cash flow just as it did in the past
- **Get paid upfront:** You get paid upfront for a service, not after you provide a service

**Bad business equals:**
- Unprofitable
- Hard to understand
- Hasn't been around for very long
- You have to provide the service before you get paid for the service
- Much harder game to win

**The trampoline vs. concrete floor:**
- **Cash flow businesses:** Have a trampoline that has a lot of give to it. You can make more mistakes as an entrepreneur because you have money coming in.
- **Cash suck businesses:** Have a concrete floor that has no give. You're going to jump out of the window sometimes and mess things up.

### Marketing Problem vs. Product Problem

**Three numbers you need to look at:**

1. **Referral rate:** How often do your customers tell somebody else that they need to buy something from you?
2. **Repurchase rate:** How often do your customers repurchase from you? They come, they buy one water bottle—not enough. You need to buy two or three.
3. **Churn:** How often do the customers, once they have you on a subscription plan or they're continuing to buy from you, bail out of that plan?

**These three numbers can tell you if you have:**
- A healthy product business, OR
- Just a great sales team

**The four R's of good business:**
1. **Reviews:** Ask your customers to say nice things about you continuously
2. **Referrals:** Get your customers to refer their friends to buy more things from you continuously
3. **Retention:** Keep them (find new customers, keep growing)
4. **Reduction of churn:** Keep them from bailing out

**The hierarchy:**
1. Always easier to sell your same customers more things continuously
2. Then you can sell your customers more expensive things continuously
3. Then you can get your customers to refer their friends to buy more things from you continuously
4. Then you can ask your customers to say nice things about you continuously (reviews)

## Part 3: Reputation and Personal Brand

### Reputation Is Your Most Valuable Asset

**Buffett's principle:** If an employee makes a mistake and loses us money, I will allow that. But if an employee makes a mistake and hurts our reputation, they will immediately be fired.

**Why:** It's very hard to get back your reputation, especially if it's your fault—you did something that is out of sync with who you say you are publicly.

### Building and Protecting Reputation

**1. Be as transparent as humanly possible:**
- On all the things good, bad, and otherwise that are true with you
- Say the quiet part out loud as often as humanly possible

**2. Inoculations against reputation:**
- Can you say things a few times that you think are very very true, but you know will be very very unpopular?
- If you do that so often, then people don't get that surprised by what you say
- Example: Joe Rogan often says the quiet part out loud. He says things he knows will be quite unpopular. Because he does that, people think he's telling the truth more often, and his audience is inoculated.

**3. Your reputation is cultivated:**
- It is this series of small decisions you make every single day that becomes the person that people think you are
- Try to really have congruence between that

**4. If you're going to try to be an influencer or celebrity:**
- It comes with the territory
- That's a decision you have to make one way or the other
- People who are very famous and well-known on the internet are obsessed with their reputation and brand. It is never by accident. This is cultivated. It is created. It is mocked up. It is PowerPoint.

**Example:** The Rock's Instagram—count how many of those pieces of content are an ad. Almost every post is. But he has such a strong brand, and every single thing that he promotes is so tied into his brand that it feels effortless. But it is absolutely not effortless.

**The principle:** Nobody gets famous by accident, for the most part. They all cultivated it.

## Part 4: Business Progression Ladders

### The Ladders of Wealth Creation

Making money is a skill that you can get better at over time. There's a reliable progression that anyone can take to earn more and build wealth—think of it as a series of ladders side by side. Each one can climb to different heights in both the quality of business and potential earnings.

**The progression:**
1. **Time for money** - Trading time for money (hourly jobs, salaried positions)
2. **Your own service business** - Running your own services business
3. **Productized services** - Taking a set offering and bundling it with a fixed price
4. **Selling products** - Physical or digital products that scale

**Key principles:**
- **Extra time and money need to be reinvested** - Increased earnings should go into new skills, investments, or businesses, not lifestyle inflation
- **You can skip ahead, but you still have to learn the lessons from each step** - Jumping ahead means learning all lessons in one place, which takes longer
- **Apply your existing skills in a new way** - Use skills you already have to build wealth (e.g., construction skills to renovate Airbnbs)
- **There's a difference between working for a better wage and truly building wealth** - Don't step backwards on the ladder
- **Use an earlier rung on the ladder to fund the next one** - Stay at your job longer to stockpile savings to fund the jump
- **Moving between ladders often means a decrease in income** - Plan for a valley to follow your current revenue peak
- **Each step is easier with an audience** - Share your journey publicly to create supporters who root for your success
- **It takes longer than you think, but the results can be incredible** - Consistently reinvesting time and money can have incredible results over time

**When is it worth it to work for a wage?**
1. When you are just getting started
2. When you are learning a new skill
3. As a step in getting to a higher rung or on to the next ladder
4. To build relationships and find mentors
5. When the work is rewarding and meaningful in its own right

**The principle:** The most important thing is that you aren't just treading water as you work for a wage. As much of that money as possible should be saved and invested to help you jump to the next ladder.

## Part 5: Focus and Business Strategy

### When to Focus vs. When to Layer

**First rodeo rule:** If it's the first rodeo and the first time you've ever run a business, do one thing really well until that thing is profitable, self-sustainable, and you don't have to focus on it 100% of the time.

**Multi-time founder:** If it's not your first rodeo and you've already had a successful exit or two, then you can get better at layering.

**The creative test:** Are they a creative or not? Does 1 plus 1 equal 3?

**Example:** Kim Kardashian has her big media empire. She's looking for better ways to monetize that audience, so she has Skims, plus she has Sky (her private equity portfolio), plus she has her cosmetics company. But they're all sort of a creative because they use her media platform, and she gets to sell similar things to her audience and increase her overall basket size.

**The principle:** It has to really ladder into the same portfolio. Otherwise, you're distracting yourself.

**Red flag:** Anytime you see a startup founder who takes capital from third parties and they start doing Twitter threads and writing blog posts—it's like a red flag (unless they're a media company). No, no, no. Stay focused.

### Company Building Tactics

**If you add something on, take something off:**
- Use stack ranking: If you decide to work on a new request, something from your current list must come off
- Get everyone together and say: "Here are the 10 things we're working on this quarter and here's the impact of each one if we don't get it done"
- When a request comes in, if you decide to work on it, the bottom item on your stack rank has to come off
- Religiously sticking to your stack ranking will help you sort through priorities

**Cultivate a creative streak for serving customers:**
- Place a super high value on every facet of the customer experience
- Build amazing brand loyalty through thoughtful gestures
- Celebrate customers when they hit their own milestones
- Show empathy when customers face challenges

**Go through your own flows—then go through them again:**
- Sign up for a fresh account and go through the entire user experience
- Click every button, writing down every little thing that may annoy users
- So much of growth is perfecting onboarding—even if you built it only six months ago, go through it again
- You'll still have bugs

**Self-serve ≠ set it and forget it:**
- Proactively think about the high-value customers that you want to reach out to, even if they come in through the product
- Use tools that notify your sales team if someone with a top 1000 domain signs up
- Pull high-value customers out for a more white-glove type of onboarding experience

**Don't fall into the signups trap:**
- Focus on engagement, not just getting more people through the door
- Track how many customers actually stick around
- Define what "fully onboarded" means for your business (e.g., receiving three payments from different customers, inviting at least two other people, putting a certain amount of content in)

**Pair first principles with advice seeking:**
- Think about company building from the ground up, but also do tons of reaching out to other founders and executives
- Take elements that you like from leading companies and blend that with your own approach
- Don't mistake not having a function for not having a role played by a team member

**Beware of the dangers of waiting too long to add a function:**
- Functions have reputations within a company
- Waiting too long to hire can create difficulties for when that function eventually does come on board
- When adding a new team or role, take the time to clarify: What a role is, what it's meant to serve, how existing people have been making up for the lack of that role, and how their lives are going to be changed by new people coming in

## Part 6: Knowing When to Stop

### Define Your Range of Tolerance

**The principle:** Life has an optimal zone to survive and reproduce. Staying within a range of acceptable tolerance in your life should be the goal, so that you flourish in all dimensions, not just the professional.

**How do I know if I'm outside my range of tolerance?**

When pushed outside our tolerance range, we experience indicators in three categories:

1. **Hormonal dysregulation:** Negative emotional states—irritable, anxious, sad, angry, withdrawn, or shut down
2. **Physiological:** Natural bodily functions are interrupted, including the musculoskeletal, respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrinal, gastrointestinal, nervous, and reproductive systems
3. **Destructive behavioral patterns:** Addictions or compulsive activities as a coping mechanism due to excess stress

**Create your tolerance list:**

1. **List of intolerables:** Things to completely avoid—variables that immediately place you outside a tolerable range
2. **List of boundaries:** Self-imposed boundaries that are favorable toward health and well-being—defensive measures to avoid the slippery slope into intolerable situations
3. **Plan to flourish:** Items that put you in your optimal zone of performance—experiences or behaviors that make you feel healthiest and at your best

**The career S-curve:**

Generally speaking, we can break our career down into three stages:
- **Foundation stage:** Setting a foundation in terms of getting your career started
- **Acceleration phase:** When we tend to push to climb the ladder—managing people and projects of increasing scale
- **Peak phase:** When we slow things down and ride the coattails of our prior work—managing entire organizations

**Office hours vs. mind hours:**
- **Office hours:** The standard measure of the number of hours you'll work where there's actual work being done
- **Mind hours:** The number of hours that your mind and nervous system are preoccupied with work because of the stresses of it
- What most people underestimate is the number of mind hours spent working, especially if your goal is to get to an executive level
- Nights and weekends, which earlier in your career were used to recover from office hours, are now spent on mind hours, eliminating most of the room for proper rest and recovery

**Benefits of periods of intolerability:**

There may be times when you decide it's necessary to expose yourself to harsher conditions. In biology, there's a concept called hormesis—all organisms have adaptive mechanisms that kick in when the organism is put under a reasonable amount of stress, and those mechanisms are adaptations that may improve the organism's tolerance or performance.

**The key:** You should consciously decide when and why a wander into the intolerable makes sense.

**Saying no to the unnecessary:**

Before you make your next major career or life decision, pause and ask yourself:
- How much money do I truly need to live the life I envision for myself?
- What would I have to sacrifice if I reduced my salary by half, and would it be worth it?
- What would I need from my job in order for it to be worth the extra labor and stress?

**The principle:** The purpose of life isn't to sacrifice our well-being. The purpose of life is to flourish. But it requires sacrifices to be made. Maybe you should turn down that promotion. Or not buy that house that will bind you to 5-10 years of additional work to pay for it.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Buy businesses, don't always build.** Past performance predicts future behavior. It's easier to buy a profitable business than start one.

2. **Good business = profitable, sustainable, historical, understandable, Lindy effect, get paid upfront.** Bad business = unprofitable, cash suck, provide service before payment.

3. **Evaluate with three numbers:** Referral rate, repurchase rate, and churn tell you if it's a healthy business or just great sales.

4. **Reputation is your most valuable asset.** Be transparent, do inoculations against reputation, cultivate it daily. It's a series of small decisions.

5. **Nobody gets famous by accident.** Personal brands are cultivated, created, and maintained intentionally.

6. **Focus vs. layer:** First rodeo = do one thing really well. Multi-time founder = can layer. Must be a creative (1+1=3) that ladders into portfolio.

7. **Stay focused.** Don't get distracted by side projects unless they ladder into your main portfolio.

8. **Understand business progression ladders.** There's a reliable progression from trading time for money to selling products. Each step requires learning new skills and reinvesting time and money.

9. **Use stack ranking.** If you add something on, take something off. Religiously stick to your priorities.

10. **Know when to stop.** Define your range of tolerance. The purpose of life is to flourish, not to sacrifice well-being. Sometimes you should turn down that promotion or not buy that house.
