# Management and Leadership: Leading Direct Reports

A comprehensive guide for managing direct reports effectively, balancing empathy with boundaries, creating a culture of rigorous thinking, and conducting performance reviews that drive improvement.

---

## Core Principle

**Be both empathetic and real with your people.** This means listening thoughtfully, honoring what they're sharing, and helping guide conversations in a productive direction. Your goal is to help your team develop right-sized reactions and correct mental models about what's going on around them.

## Part 1: Empathetic Management (Without Becoming a Therapist)

### When to Apply
- When team members share frustrations or grievances
- During 1:1s after sharing tough news
- When you need to do sentiment checks
- When managing emotional situations

### Key Principles

#### 1. Don't Try to Be Their Therapist

I believe most managers act as therapists sometimes, in the sense that you listen and support. But as a manager, you must assess your direct reports' work and potential. Therefore, there's a conflict of interest that actual therapists don't have.

If your team thinks they can share all their frustrations completely unencumbered and at full strength, you can't help but take this into account when considering their ability to be promoted. You can't help but judge their emotional regulation and ability to handle stress.

In other words, you don't want to mislead your team into believing they can talk to you too openly. You want to listen AND you want them to remember that you are still their manager—mainly for their own sake.

#### 2. Listen, Then Direct the Conversation in a More Actionable Direction

Let the person share and listen thoughtfully. Then, try to direct the conversation in an actionable direction:

- How can we make this better?
- What's within our control that we can do?
- How can I (their manager) potentially provide air coverage in the meantime?

**Example:**
> "I hear you that X is really frustrating. I agree it shouldn't have to feel this hard and you've been handling it well so far. What can we do to potentially improve this? What might help you feel more confident and grounded in this situation?"

Notice how this directs the conversation away from venting, and toward what we can do about the problem. You want your direct report to start thinking of potential solutions, and to know you support them in figuring out a solution.

The more airtime you give a topic, the more concrete and real it becomes. Obviously, this does not mean we can only talk about happy things and pretend problems don't exist.

It means to find balance in:
- (A) allowing direct reports to speak openly, knowing they can air their grievances
- (B) reminding them that as individuals who have agency and your full support, it's also part of their responsibility to try to think of a solution.

#### 3. Don't Jump Too Quickly to Offering Solutions

One of the common mistakes I see when leaders try to execute this empathetic-yet-realistic approach is they move on TOO quickly to a solution.

When you go straight to a solution without acknowledging what you heard, it reads like you're dismissing them. It sounds like you were waiting for them to finish, so you could solve this and move on.

**This might be efficient, but it's not effective, because your team member likely doesn't only want solutions--they also want to feel heard.**

Instead, spend a few minutes restating what they said, so you demonstrate that you were, in fact, listening.

**❌ Don't:**
> "Hmm I agree, this isn't ideal. What might we do to improve this situation?"

**✅ Do:**
> "Hmm I agree, this isn't ideal. I knew this was a challenge but I didn't realize until now that it was taking this much of your bandwidth every week. I'm glad you're speaking up because I can see why you're feeling frustrated. What do you think we could do to make this better?"

Notice the "after" was still concise, but comes across as more sincere.

#### 4. Push Back Gently to Encourage a Right-Sized Reaction

If you believe your recipient is being a bit hyperbolic, you may push back gently to help them see the situation through a different frame. This is not only kind, but necessary.

If your direct report has an aggrandized extreme view of the situation, this has a real cost. Due to their beliefs, they may act assuming they have a moral high ground for being right, when in fact they have an incorrect or incomplete mental model about the situation.

**Example:**
> "X is definitely frustrating--[add an extra line about this so they see that you understand]. At the same time, we don't want to catastrophize. X is a change for sure, but in some ways, it's not super different from what we were doing before. For example, [ways the new process is similar to the old process]. But I totally see your point and agree the change will take some time to get used to."

Or:
> "I hear you that during launches, it's a more hectic time. I'm here and ready to support, and I'm going to need to rely on you to tell me how I can help. Also, on the bright side, we have to do X every few quarters, so while this does make things more hectic, it's also cyclical. We know this too shall pass. We know things will feel upended for a week or so, then will settle into a new rhythm, so I want us to remember that too."

I feel like modern discourse is often about how you should let people feel how they feel, there's no wrong way to feel, everyone processes news differently, etc.

And while I generally agree, **I believe it's our responsibility to help our team develop right-sized reactions or correct mental models about what's going on around them.**

Remember: If your team has gone too far into venting mode, this may impact their performance and feed delusions that aren't useful for anyone.

## Part 2: Creating a Culture of Rigorous Thinking

### When to Apply
- When team members bring ideas or recommendations
- During strategy discussions
- When coaching direct reports on decision-making
- When you want to raise the bar for thinking quality

### Key Principles

#### 1. Rigorous Thinking Starts at the Top

If you set a high bar and celebrate thoughtful decision-making, you send a signal that rigor matters. You don't let your team get away with lazy assumptions, subpar work, or latch onto surface-level conclusions that don't capture an accurate picture of the underlying truth.

#### 2. No Ideas Are Precious or Off-Limits

You may need to model for your team what healthy debate looks like. Mainly, this means leading by example because culture is basically people looking around to see what things are like around here.

To establish a norm of rigorous thinking, encourage your team to speak up if they disagree, and to do so respectfully and openly. And when questions are asked of them, to react positively and see the questions as a gift.

#### 3. Create Psychological Safety

If you want to encourage sparring and healthy debates, you need a foundation of psychological safety. Your team has to trust that you care, and trust that you're asking hard questions because it's better for them, the team, and the idea itself. No one is trying to make anyone look bad or feel stupid.

This is not an interrogation. The way you ask matters. Ask hard questions in a way that's supportive and driven by curiosity, not contempt. When you take this approach, you empower your team members to figure out and articulate a solution.

#### 4. A Yes or No Without Context Is a Missed Opportunity for Learning

If you only say yes or no to ideas, your team will keep coming back to you with a similar level of ideas. They won't know why a strategic proposal worked or didn't. If you want something to change, it's your responsibility to invest the time to share your thought process, give feedback, and coach them on how to think differently.

The end result of whether you move forward with an idea isn't as important as the thought process behind it.

#### 5. Be a Sparring Partner

It's hard, if not near impossible, to learn how to think strategically by reading a book. Understanding a concept in theory is not the same as understanding it in practice. This is why managers must make the time to engage in conversation with their direct reports.

Not just conversation about status updates and project management—but deeper conversations about upcoming decisions, challenges your team is facing, and detailed feedback on work output. This is how you unlock the power of hands on, on-the-job learning.

As a manager, you likely have more experience or context than your team members do. Something might feel obvious to you, but isn't to them, so try to stay curious and get more information before assuming incompetence.

Remember: You hired intelligent people, and your best high performers already want to think rigorously. Be their thought partner.

#### 6. Let Others Speak

Let's be honest: We managers love sharing our brilliant ideas with a captive audience. It takes self-restraint and hyper-vigilance on our part to stop and let our direct reports talk.

A solution that's worked for me is taking the decision-making out of the equation in real time, and instead, relying on an easy-to-remember question that becomes muscle memory: "What do you think?"

#### 7. Rigorous Thinking Can Be Lightweight

Rigorous thinking might be conflated with intense processes, long write-ups, and filling out documentation, but I see the two as different. Personally, I hate overkill processes that snuff out creativity and make the lift so high to share an idea that you want to skip sharing it altogether.

Rigorous thinking can be as simple as spending 5 minutes running through a few basic questions.

## Part 3: Performance Reviews and Feedback

### When to Apply
- During performance reviews
- When a direct report's self-assessment doesn't match your assessment
- When someone needs to improve but might react emotionally
- When you need to be honest without demotivating them

### Key Principles

#### 1. Strategy vs Self-Expression

Pare it back to the most critical feedback. What one thing can they work on that will make the biggest improvement? Focus on what to do differently moving forward, not past infractions.

**Strategy** = Only saying things that will incentivize the person to change in the right direction (probably 10% of what you initially want to say).

**Self-expression** = Venting, having the last word, or trying to teach someone a lesson. Anything that isn't 100% going to encourage improvement.

#### 2. If They Already Feel Remorseful, Don't Pour Salt in the Wound

If they messed up and already feel remorseful, there are diminishing returns to continuing to emphasize the damage. It makes them feel worse (less motivated) or defensive (less motivated).

Channel their emotions in a more productive direction instead.

#### 3. Take Responsibility for Your Role

When you take responsibility for your role in a situation, you engender massive amounts of goodwill. Most managers won't admit that anything is their fault.

Say things like:
- "It's on me that I didn't do X"
- "I should have set you up for success by doing Y"

This usually makes the other person more willing to acknowledge how they contributed.

#### 4. Acknowledge Strengths and Weaknesses as Two Sides of the Same Coin

Frame weaknesses as the shadow side of strengths.

**Example:**
> "Creativity, big picture thinking, and storytelling are your strengths, which makes you so great at X. The shadow side of this is I've noticed you're more likely to be very light on quantitative analysis and subconsciously avoid data. This totally makes sense, but the impact is [negative impact]. Going forward, I need to be on top of the weekly metrics so we can..."

**Why this works:** You're not triggering their ego. You're explaining that they're bad at X because they're good at Y, but we still need to address X.

#### 5. Cite Task-Relevant Maturity

You're NOT commenting on whether your team member is intelligent and capable. You're simply mentioning this person's experience, and therefore judgment, with a certain topic.

**Example:**
> "I thought you had more task-relevant maturity in this area than I realized. I was surprised by XYZ. That's on me. Going forward, it might make sense for us to be more closely aligned as you ramp up on this. What that looks like is... And when X happens, let's have you do..."

This removes shame around the conversation. You're both wanting to find out the best way to increase their impact.

#### 6. Replace "But" with "At the Same Time"

"But" negates all the nice things you said before. Your recipient will only hear what comes after "but."

**❌ Don't:**
> "I really like how you X. But when you Y, it has this negative impact."

**✅ Do:**
> "I really like how you X. At the same time, when you Y, it has this negative impact."

"At the same time" signals a difference like "but" does without the negativity.

#### 7. Quote the Person Back to Themselves

Leverage cognitive dissonance and the principle of consistency. People want to be consistent with what they said and who they think they are.

**Example:**
> "You've mentioned you always want me to give you direct feedback and push you to be better. This is one of those times. I'm saying this to you because I know this wasn't your best work, and I know this doesn't reflect your abilities."
