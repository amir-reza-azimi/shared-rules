# Negotiating Raises and Higher Earnings

A practical guide for negotiating higher compensation, positioning yourself as a profit center, and successfully asking for raises at your company.

---

## Core Principle

**Your biggest ROI is on you and your time.** Once you understand that, it's: How can you make your time your best investment possible? Position yourself as a profit center, negotiate a percentage of the value you create, and remember: The first no is not the final no.

---

## Part 1: Positioning for Higher Earnings

### Understand How a Business Makes Money

**The key insight:** Your biggest ROI is on you and your time. Once you understand that, it's: How can you make your time your best investment possible?

**How to increase earnings:**

1. **Understand how a business makes money:** Understand how you make money for a business and how every action you make makes a business more or less money.

2. **Determine if you're a cost center or profit center:** 
   - Are you directly contributing to revenue?
   - Are you helping somebody contribute to revenue?
   - Or are you a cost?
   - If you're a cost, what are you doing there?

3. **Get on the profit center side:** Sales jobs, leadership roles, recruiting jobs—jobs where if you work more and hit your goals, you can make more money.

---

## Part 2: Negotiating a Percentage of Value Created

### The Revenue-Sharing Approach

**Negotiate a percentage of the money you make the business:**

> "Hey, I want to make more money at this company, but I would never want to take more money just because I want it—of course I understand how business works. Instead, I was thinking: If I hit this goal which is 25% above the goal that you set for me, I'd love to make 5% of that additional 25% I brought in. You get to keep the extra 20%, you beat your goals, I look good compared to all the rest of everybody else, and I make money if you make money. Would you be open to something like that?"

**Why this works:**
- You're aligning your interests with the company's
- You're not asking for money without providing value
- You're creating a win-win situation
- You're demonstrating business acumen

**The principle:** Position yourself as someone who creates value, not someone who costs money. When you create value, you deserve a percentage of it.

## Part 3: The GAINS Negotiation Framework

### Your Negotiation Playbook

Every successful negotiation starts with leverage. Whether you're planning six months ahead or sitting in discussions right now, use the GAINS framework:

**G: Gather intelligence.** Go beyond the obvious. Dig into the company's real challenges, understand who truly makes decisions (hint: it's not always on the org chart), and know their market better than they do.

**A: Align with their needs.** Stop selling your resume. Start demonstrating how you'll solve their specific problems for the company/team. When you position yourself as the solution to their challenges—not just another candidate—the power dynamic shifts immediately.

**I: Influence key stakeholders.** Create champions throughout the organization, not just with the hiring manager. Show each stakeholder how you'll make their world better, and they'll fight for your compensation later.

**N: Navigate complexity.** Master the delicate dance of pushing for what you're worth without creating tension. Know exactly when to advance discussions and when to build relationships. Timing is everything.

**S: Secure your value.** Get agreements right, start delivering value before day one, and build the foundation for your long-term success.

### Gather Intelligence That Others Miss

**Organization dynamics:**
- Identify who gets consulted before decisions are made (often not who you'd expect)
- Learn which past failures still haunt leadership thinking
- Discover which rising stars have the CEO's ear
- Uncover the true drivers that aren't discussed openly

**Decision-maker psychology:**
- Research what motivates each key player both professionally and personally
- Identify formative experiences that shaped their leadership philosophy
- Discover what problems truly keep them awake at night
- Learn how they measure success beyond the obvious metrics

**Strategic pain points:**
- Track where the company is headed, not just where it's been
- Identify problems they'll face six months from now
- Understand which initiatives have underdelivered and why
- Use your experience to form an opinion about what must be done

### Align with Advocates

**Storytelling:**
- Connect your past challenges directly to their current problems
- Share the messy middle of your experiences, not just outcomes
- Focus on lessons learned that directly apply to their situation
- Use stories as bridges to solutions, not as evidence of your greatness

**Child-like curiosity:**
- Ask questions that reveal your strategic thinking
- Challenge assumptions respectfully
- Inquire about root causes rather than symptoms
- Demonstrate you've done your homework through the specificity of your questions

**"Sell the vacation":**
- Paint a vivid picture of what success looks like after you join
- Get specific about the changes you'd implement in the first 30, 90, and 180 days
- Connect your vision to metrics they already care about
- Make them feel the relief of having their problems solved

### Influence Momentum by Adding Value

**Influence isn't about manipulation but about creating real value in every interaction:**
- Build champions across functions and levels
- Understand how power flows through organizations
- Create value in every interaction
- Use story selection, relationship building, and value demonstration

---

## Part 4: Negotiation and the First No

### The First No Is Not the Final No

**The principle:** The first no is really the final no—if you stop at the first no, that's a great line. You're done. But most people are not going to go past the first no, so you've already differentiated yourself.

**Learning from other cultures:**
- Americans in particular are brought up not to negotiate. It's like: "The price is the price."
- A lot of other cultures: The price is the starting point.
- Learning from other cultures on negotiation is such a life hack because they do it like a second language.

**The approach:**
- Every time you ask for something, there's a big smile
- Very diminutive, kind of shrugged shoulders: "Well, we could do this, but like we could do that. What do you think about that?"
- The whole time you're negotiating with them, you like the guy

**Examples:**
- Go into coffee shops (even Starbucks) and order a coffee, then go: "I'd love a discount." Then shut up.
- "Well, I'd just love one, like if that was at all possible. Is there any way for me to get a discount?"
- Often you are rejected, but sometimes you are not.

**The principle:** How often is money sitting right in front of you, but you're just not doing what it takes to grab it? Asking and rejection is one of the biggest reasons why we don't.

### The 10 Commandments of Salary Negotiation

**1. Negotiation starts earlier than you think**
- Every recruiter worth their salt will ask about your salary expectations when you first start interviewing
- Do not give them a number
- Ask for the range they're budgeted for the role: "Can you tell me the salary band for this level? Happy to let you know if it's within my range, and we can discuss specific numbers later when I've met the team."

**2. Mine for intel during interviews**
- Go into the interview ready not just to answer questions but to ask some of your own
- Ask: What's the biggest priority for the team right now? Why is this role open? What's the biggest challenge for someone stepping into this role? How does the org structure on the team work?

**3. Don't give in to the pressure**
- Once you've been offered the role, the recruiter's job shifts from evaluating you to closing you
- Most experienced recruiters will ask you again to put up a number for your salary
- Clever recruiters may even tell you that they "will go to bat for you"—don't give in

**4. At FAANG, your recruiter may have no say at all**
- At FAANG-size companies (over 5K employees), compensation is heavily formulaic
- There is often a separate team—the "compensation committee"—who sets your salary
- Companies will consider "new information," like another offer, to reopen a negotiation
- An offer to stay from your existing company also counts!

**5. Read between the lines**
- Your initial offer speaks volumes
- **Initial offer comes in low:** The team may have felt that you have a lot of "room for growth"
- **Middle of the road:** You got "the number" (the medium opening number that's basically a template recruiters use)
- **Initial offer comes in top-of-band:** There was likely a discussion about giving you a higher level

**6. At a startup, the playbook is different**
- You may be dealing with the founder directly
- It's very likely there is no range for the role
- The goal at the initial offer conversation is to understand: The current state of the company (financing, runway, profitability), the plan for your role/function, the value of the equity
- Ask the questions an investor would ask because you are now an investor—but instead of cash, you're staking your time and earning trajectory

**7. Your job is to win hearts and minds**
- Don't negotiate now that you have data—not yet
- The next step is to upsell your worth before you come back with any kind of counteroffer
- Ask for follow-up meetings with decision makers
- Come prepared with: Questions about how you can create meaningful impact, ideas based on your interviews so far, bonus points: discussing obstacles to your taking the role and making them sell you on it

**8. Get some good data**
- Is the offer competitive?
- How does it work? (When do I vest; what is the stock worth?)
- Is it all true? (Is the value of the equity over-inflated?)
- Does it add up? (Consider taxes on bonuses and stock.)
- If you have goaled comp, are the goals realistic?

**9. Comparing offers**
- Not all offers are made equal—in fact, they are intentionally confusing
- Look beyond comp: Which company has a better trajectory? How do promotions work? Is your manager influential enough to pull for you when needed? Is your product or team visible enough to get good resourcing? What's the company brand worth to your earnings trajectory?
- Getting paid more up-front doesn't always mean you'll make the most overall

**10. Time to make an ask**
- It can be awkward to ask for more money, but trust me, everyone expects you to do it
- **MYTH:** You absolutely do not need multiple offers. Just being able to say you're speaking to other companies is sufficient
- **MYTH:** You need to provide copies of your other offers. Nope—you signed an NDA before every interview
- **MYTH:** Negotiating via email = MAJOR CRINGE. Have the conversation over the phone if you want a meaningful/large increase
- **MYTH:** "It says X on Glassdoor." Compensation is an exact science—have arguments prepared that are specific to your situation
- **MYTH:** The best way to get more is to reiterate how qualified I am. You already got interviewed—now you need to build additional arguments
- **MYTH:** I need to be aggressive and threaten to walk if they don't match. If you want big moves, you need to collaborate with your recruiter, not make them an enemy
- Start with negotiating your overall compensation, not individual components

## Part 5: Career Positioning and Growth

### Take Control of Your Desk

**The principle:** Find the right company and the right manager, and you can take control of your desk to carve out the right role for yourself. Find yourself at the wrong company or working for the wrong manager, and you'll hit a wall, even if you're incredibly talented.

**How to evaluate if a company will foster career growth:**

**Make space to bring your career motivations into clearer focus:**
- Take time to think about it—sometimes people approach career growth from a place of fear and anxiety
- Take a step back—every time you go on vacation, you have an epiphany because you're not getting distracted
- Remember there's much more to it than a new title or a salary bump

**When assessing a company, look for these mile markers:**
- Pay attention to the investment cycle: Who has invested, how much, who's leading the round, who's coming back to lead another round?
- Keep an eye out for movement in the C-Suite—when that changing of the guard happens, that may be a signal something big is coming
- Drill down into how the particular role you're eyeing fits into the company's growth trajectory
- For a company that's at least a couple of years old, look for folks who are sticking around and flexing different skills

**Put career growth front and center in the interview:**
- Don't shy away from the harder questions—set the tone for taking control of your desk during the interview process
- Ask about the one, three, five-year future where they see the company growing
- Probe their goals and what they're striving for—and more importantly, is there a clear plan around those goals?
- Ask what the career path is for the particular role you're interviewing for

**How to grow your career by aligning company needs with your own aspirations:**
- You shouldn't limit yourself to roles that have already been created
- Pay attention to your own skill-sets, passions and goals that may overlap with untapped opportunities
- The greatest opportunities for growth are at the intersection of the needs of the business, and flexing your metaphorical muscles
- When you present a new project or make your case for taking on a new role, always start from the framing of: Why would they say yes to this suggestion?

### Finding the Right Environment

**Impact = Environment × Skills**

The environment at a company is made up of the variables outside of your control that allow you to do your best work:

**Environment variables include:**
- Manager
- Resources
- Scope
- Team
- Compensation
- Company Culture

**Skills are the things that you can control:**
- Communication
- Influence
- Leadership
- Strategic Thinking
- Execution

**The principle:** No matter how hard you work, if the environment isn't right for you, your impact won't be as meaningful. The MOST important variable in the equation is actually your direct manager. A great manager can advocate for you, request more resources, help develop your skills, and a whole lot more.

**Building your own career path:**
- The career ladder is dead—feel unburdened to start thinking about your journey more as a rock climbing wall, a jungle gym, or an escalator
- Sometimes you need to take a step sideways or down
- Sometimes you'll feel like it's easier than it should be
- Embrace the journey and don't fight to ascend a downward escalator when one heading upwards is out there

**Accentuating what you're good at:**
- Not every highly motivated and skilled individual wants to become a people manager
- Leaning into the handful of unique skills that set you apart from the pack can help accelerate your career growth
- The further you move up in a company the harder it becomes to learn the basics of other areas
- Being in a position where you can gain a lot of cross-functional experience and tackle new challenges early in your career will set you up for success later
- The idea of being T-shaped is a good way to think about how to preserve some of your optionality while also specializing in areas that you are truly great

**Speaking up when you get the chance:**
- There are a few pivotal moments that can define your career
- When those moments happen, will you be ready?
- Sometimes it comes down to being the right person, in the right place, at the right time
- Even if you don't feel like the right person, should you take the risk or stay the course?
- If you don't speak up, no one is going to know you want to take on a new role or responsibility
- It's really helped to be able to tell someone, "I have no idea what I'm doing. Can you help me?"
