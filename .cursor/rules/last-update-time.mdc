# Last Update Time Rule

When any rule file in this project (`.md` files in the root directory) is modified and committed, **automatically update the "Last updated" date** in the instruction block at the top of the file.

## Applicable Files
This rule applies to **all `.md` files in the root directory** that contain the instruction block format with a "Last updated" field, including:
- Current rule files (feedback.md, managing-up.md, management-leadership.md, strategic-thinking.md, writing-guide.md, wealth-building.md)
- Any future rule files added to the project

## Format
The date should be in the format: **Month DD, YYYY** (e.g., "January 4, 2026")

## Location
The date appears in the instruction block after the frontmatter, in this format:
```
> **Last updated:** [Current Date]
```

## When to Update
- When committing changes to any rule file (`.md` files in root directory)
- When pushing to main branch
- Use the current date at the time of the commit/push
- Apply to any `.md` file that has the instruction block format, regardless of filename

## Command to Get Current Date
Use: `date "+%B %d, %Y"` to get the formatted date string.

## Detection
To identify if a file needs the date updated, check if it:
1. Is a `.md` file in the root directory (not in subdirectories)
2. Contains the pattern `> **Last updated:**` in an instruction block after the frontmatter
3. If both conditions are met, update the date when the file is modified
