# Strategic Thinking: Assertions and Rigorous Thinking

A guide for moving beyond insights to assertions, and for creating a culture of rigorous thinking that leads to better decisions and outcomes.

---

## Core Principle

**An insight is just a starting point. The rare, courageous thing to do is to develop an assertion—a hypothesis and point of view that answers "so what?"** Rigorous thinking is asking critical questions about tactics and having a systematic way of making decisions.

---

## Part 1: Insights, Suggestions, and Assertions

### The Hierarchy

**Insights** → **Suggestions** → **Assertions**

#### Insights (Just a Start)

When you point out an insight, you're calling attention to an observation, something you noticed. In response, your colleague could say, "Hmm interesting. That's nice to know." They carry on with their day. You carry on with yours. Nothing changes.

**Example:**
> "I'm seeing a lot of high-end designers using plaid."
> "Leggings sales have been steadily going up while pants sales stayed constant."

#### Suggestions (Better, But Still Off the Hook)

When you make a suggestion, you're putting forth a recommendation. You're proposing a few different options to choose from. But you're still not on the hook because your boss ultimately decides what to do. And the person who decides holds the emotional burden of that decision.

#### Assertions (The Real Deal)

When you make an assertion, all of a sudden, things get real. You're on the hook because there's more of you in what you're positing. You're now advocating for your point of view and trying to convince others to support you.

### Assertions Have Three Parts

An assertion is your thesis. Assertions typically include:

1. **A bias toward action**: You aren't just pointing out a fact in a vacuum. You're connecting dots, interpreting the situation, and positing what your team should do with this information to move forward. An assertion has to answer, "So what?"

2. **A point of view with personal conviction**: You believe in this enough to look someone in the eye and try to convince them to do this. There's an element of advocacy built into assertions.

3. **Ownership**: You are willing to take responsibility for trying this idea. You're going to be the go-to person responsible. You're saying, "If I were in charge, here's what I would do, here's where I would go, here's what I'm betting on."

### Assertions Require Your Point of View

A fact, as a standalone, is just a fact. A fact, interpreted by you, is given meaning about what the implications are.

It's not about isolated facts here and there—it's those facts, as interpreted through YOUR LENS. This includes your background, the accumulation of your experiences, your values, your interpretation of the data, your instincts, your sense of judgment.

Think of it this way: if you just had to follow directions down to a tee, your manager could hire someone on Upwork. They're a lot more affordable than you are. And what's even more affordable? Claude or ChatGPT.

Any repeatable, clearly defined task can be done better by AI than by a human. We want you to do the job that only humans can do. Connect dots. See patterns. Come to a conclusion about what you think this means—and what we should do about it.

### Making Assertions in Times of Uncertainty

You might wonder, "Do I have to be 100% certain before I make an assertion?"

No, you're not claiming to have all the answers. When you're building something new, the work is messy and no one has the right answer. The fact that no one has the right answer is precisely why assertions are so valuable.

**Here's a simple framework for creating assertions:**

> "Based on my insight of X, I believe that Y is true. To go a step further, given X and Y, I think we should do Z. I think it'll work because A and B. If it doesn't work, there's a risk of C happening, and I'll take care of that by doing D."

You're saying, "I'm willing to look you in the eye and fight for this idea to become real. I've done the rigorous thinking about how this would work. And I will take responsibility if it goes awry."

### Don't Just Ask Questions. Try to Answer Them Too

Many people ask a smart question, and stop there. Asking smart questions is a start, but it isn't enough. That's step one. Step two is asserting your answer to said question.

**When you just ask a question, it puts 100% responsibility on the other person to respond with their assertion.**

For hard problems, your counterpart has likely asked themselves smart questions many times before. If all it took were a question, they would have figured it out already.

Don't just ask questions. Professionals and A-players ask great questions, then assert how to answer those questions too. They don't claim to know everything, but they do have a point of view about how to solve the problem they just presented.

When you assert an answer, it moves the conversation forward because it helps fill in the blanks.

## Part 2: Rigorous Thinking

### What Is Rigorous Thinking?

Rigorous thinking is asking critical questions about tactics, and having a systematic way of making decisions.

Rigorous thinking isn't a single mental model. It's an approach to problem solving that allows you to deconstruct ideas, gain clarity, and make decisions that are far more likely to be right.

Counterintuitively, rigorous thinking saves you time. Instead of jumping to execute the first idea you think of, you run through basic considerations to stress test your own logic. This, in turn, means less time wasted on fixing easily avoidable mistakes, and more time spent on ideas worth pursuing.

### Rigorous Thinking vs Lazy Thinking

**Lazy thinking** is making assumptions you don't even know are assumptions. Lazy thinking is assuming your idea simply works, or that someone else will be in charge of "figuring out the details." Lazy thinkers consider anything they don't want to do (usually the hard part of actually solving a problem) to be "the details."

Lazy thinking is having a black box of logic where "suddenly it works and we have thousands of customers."

**Rigorous thinking** means:
> "Hey boss, I recommend we do ___. It's likely to work and is worth the time and budget because ___. The downside and potential risks are ___. But we can minimize the risk with a small experiment by doing ___."

In this world, you rarely say no to an idea, because it's not about saying yes or no. It's about vetting an idea. You ask strategic questions, so your employee ends up realizing themselves that the idea won't work in its current iteration.

### Creating a Culture of Rigorous Thinking

#### 1. Rigorous Thinking Starts at the Top

If you set a high bar and celebrate thoughtful decision-making, you send a signal that rigor matters. You don't let your team get away with lazy assumptions, subpar work, or latch onto surface-level conclusions that don't capture an accurate picture of the underlying truth.

#### 2. No Ideas Are Precious or Off-Limits

You may need to model for your team what healthy debate looks like. Mainly, this means leading by example because culture is basically people looking around to see what things are like around here.

To establish a norm of rigorous thinking, encourage your team to speak up if they disagree, and to do so respectfully and openly. And when questions are asked of them, to react positively and see the questions as a gift.

#### 3. Create Psychological Safety

If you want to encourage sparring and healthy debates, you need a foundation of psychological safety. Your team has to trust that you care, and trust that you're asking hard questions because it's better for them, the team, and the idea itself. No one is trying to make anyone look bad or feel stupid.

This is not an interrogation. The way you ask matters. Ask hard questions in a way that's supportive and driven by curiosity, not contempt. When you take this approach, you empower your team members to figure out and articulate a solution.

#### 4. A Yes or No Without Context Is a Missed Opportunity for Learning

If you only say yes or no to ideas, your team will keep coming back to you with a similar level of ideas. They won't know why a strategic proposal worked or didn't. If you want something to change, it's your responsibility to invest the time to share your thought process, give feedback, and coach them on how to think differently.

The end result of whether you move forward with an idea isn't as important as the thought process behind it.

#### 5. Be a Sparring Partner

It's hard, if not near impossible, to learn how to think strategically by reading a book. Understanding a concept in theory is not the same as understanding it in practice. This is why managers must make the time to engage in conversation with their direct reports.

Not just conversation about status updates and project management—but deeper conversations about upcoming decisions, challenges your team is facing, and detailed feedback on work output. This is how you unlock the power of hands on, on-the-job learning.

As a manager, you likely have more experience or context than your team members do. Something might feel obvious to you, but isn't to them, so try to stay curious and get more information before assuming incompetence.

Remember: You hired intelligent people, and your best high performers already want to think rigorously. Be their thought partner.

#### 6. Let Others Speak

Let's be honest: We managers love sharing our brilliant ideas with a captive audience. It takes self-restraint and hyper-vigilance on our part to stop and let our direct reports talk.

A solution that's worked for me is taking the decision-making out of the equation in real time, and instead, relying on an easy-to-remember question that becomes muscle memory: "What do you think?"

#### 7. Prioritize and Unpack Ideas with More Specificity

Rigorous thinking is realizing that 90% of ideas are probably not worth doing, and the ones that are worth doing, won't just magically work. It's realizing that many ideas are decent, but decent doesn't meet the bar for moving forward when you have limited resources (and resources are always limited, even at large organizations).

Even when you don't move forward with an idea, though, there might be a nub of an insight that can evolve and take on a different form. When you share your rationale and logic, you allow others (and yourself) to push back on specific parts. Instead of throwing out an entire idea, you can discuss with more granularity.

#### 8. Rigorous Thinking Can Be Lightweight

Rigorous thinking might be conflated with intense processes, long write-ups, and filling out documentation, but I see the two as different. Personally, I hate overkill processes that snuff out creativity and make the lift so high to share an idea that you want to skip sharing it altogether.

Rigorous thinking can be as simple as spending 5 minutes running through a few basic questions.

## Part 3: Questions to Promote Rigorous Thinking

Vague ideas are hard to discuss and debate. That's why fleshing out the mechanics and logic behind your idea can help you gain conviction. Here's a non-exhaustive list of questions to get started:

1. What's the hard part?
2. What does success look like?
3. Is the juice worth the squeeze?
4. Who is this for? What is this for?
5. What are potential reasons not to do this, i.e. counterpoints?
6. What is our unfair advantage for doing this?
7. What are areas of risk and how might we mitigate?
8. Why is this likely to work and be a good investment?
9. What evidence, data, and examples am I pulling from?
10. What assets, levers, and constraints are we working with?
11. Who do we need buy-in from in order to move forward?
12. What's the upside, downside, and trade-offs?
13. Where might I be making an assumption or logical leap that doesn't make sense?
14. How can we test this in the lowest-overhead way possible?
15. How does this stack rank against other ideas for driving the business?
16. If we decided to move forward today, what would you need to bring this to life?
17. Can we do this ourselves, or do we need to tap into other teams?
18. Why would your target audience be excited to do the thing you want them to do?

Not every question here will be applicable to you, but at least a few should jump out and spark your thinking. And you may want to add your own go-to questions unique to your situation and function.

Keep in mind: Asking these questions is only a start. Much of the real learning for your direct reports will happen in conversation with you—when you debate and discuss ideas, with you as their sparring partner.

## Part 4: Why Assertions Take Courage

When you share an assertion, you could end up being wrong. Or your peers or boss could disagree with you.

We don't like when people disagree with us. We don't like being wrong. So we come up with all kinds of "rational" excuses about why we had an insight or suggestion... But stopped short of an assertion.

- "If I had spoken up, it wouldn't have mattered anyway."
- "I have a hunch, but I need more data before I can say anything out loud."
- "Who am I to assert what we should do? The leaders here know better than I do."

Asserting is a generous thing to do because it gives other people something to work with. Even if someone disagrees with your assertion, you're adding value because it helps your team come to a better understanding of the challenge or proposed solution.

Insights are a dime a dozen. Suggestions are a bit better, but still let you off the hook. Assertions are the realm of professionals who navigate ambiguity and rigorous thinking.

Assertions make an idea real. The sooner the ball gets rolling, the sooner you can iterate to make the idea better.
